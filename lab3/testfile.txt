Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.
Cameron.	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.	That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...	Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.	That's because it's such a nice one.
That's because it's such a nice one.	Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.	Where?
You got something on your mind?	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?	Tons
"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."	I was?
I was?	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...	Then that's all you had to say.
Then that's all you had to say.	But
But	You always been this selfish?
"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""	No...
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
What crap?	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
What good stuff?	"The ""real you""."
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"	No
No	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow	Let's go.
She okay?	I hope so.
They do to!	They do not!
Did you change your hair?	No.
No.	You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
Who?	Joey.
Great	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.	Is he oily or dry?
Is he oily or dry?	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?	I did.
It's more	Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?	Hopefully.
"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."	Queen Harry?
Queen Harry?	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
Hi, Joey.	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.	Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?	What do you think?
What do you think?	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.	What's normal?
What's normal?	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.	Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.	You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.	Like you care.
Like you care.	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?	What?
What?	In 9th.  For a month
In 9th.  For a month	Why?
Why?	He was, like, a total babe
He was, like, a total babe	But you hate Joey
But you hate Joey	Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.	As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
You did what?	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But	"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself	Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.	I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
Let go!	You set me up.
You set me up.	I just wanted --
I just wanted --	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?	No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?	It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.	Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	What if she never starts dating?
What if she never starts dating?	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?
And where're you going?	If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.	Otherwise known as an orgy?
Otherwise known as an orgy?	"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.	Daddy, no!
Daddy, no!	Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
Why?	Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --	The prom?  Kat has a date?
The prom?  Kat has a date?	No, but
No, but	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?	"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?	Never

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?	Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
So they tell me...	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?	North, actually.  How'd you   ?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?	I was kidding. People actually live there?

How many people go here?	Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --	You burn, you pine, you perish?
You burn, you pine, you perish?	Who is she?
Who is she?	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it	Why not?
Why not?	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.	He always have that shit-eating grin?
He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?	You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?	He seems like he thrives on danger
He seems like he thrives on danger	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?	That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.	I thought you hated those people.
I thought you hated those people.	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.	Will Bogey get bent?
Will Bogey get bent?	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
It's a lung cancer issue	Her favorite uncle
Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.	No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.	Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.	Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?	She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?	Sure
Sure	Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?	She kissed me.
She kissed me.	Where?
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
Where ya goin?	Away.
Away.	Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
Yeah	What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.	You just said
You just said	You need money to take a girl out
You need money to take a girl out	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.	How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.	Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.	I'm on it
I'm on it	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price	What?
What?	A hundred bucks a date.
A hundred bucks a date.	Forget it.
Forget it.	Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?	Do what?
Do what?	Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.	Are you lost?
Are you lost?	Nope - just came by to chat
Nope - just came by to chat	We don't chat.
We don't chat.	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?	Does this conversation have a purpose?
Does this conversation have a purpose?	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*	You and Verona?

He always look so	Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.	Just a little.
What's this?	An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.	William would never have gone to a state school.
William would never have gone to a state school.	William didn't even go to high school
William didn't even go to high school	That's never been proven
That's never been proven	Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?	Does it matter?
Does it matter?	"If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
You think this'll work?	No fear.
What'd he say?	Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.	I didn't have a choice.
I didn't have a choice.	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.	You didn't
You didn't	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.	Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway	You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.	Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?	Who?
Who?	William - he asked me to meet him here.
William - he asked me to meet him here.	Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.	My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then	Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?	I know a lot more than that

I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.	And why would I do that?
And why would I do that?	Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...	You -- covered in my vomit.

I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.	Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?	That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what you want, isn't it?	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.

Why?	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.	Like you could find one
Like you could find one	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?

Who?	Dorsey.
Dorsey.	I hate him.
I hate him.	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.	"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"	I thought you were above all that
I thought you were above all that	You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!	What?
And I'm in control of it.	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?	Busy
Busy	Were you in jail?
Were you in jail?	Maybe.
Maybe.	No, you weren't
No, you weren't	Then why'd you ask?
Then why'd you ask?	Why'd you lie?
I should do this.	Do what?
Do what?	This.
Start a band?	My father wouldn't approve of that that
My father wouldn't approve of that that	You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.	Who?
Who?	BIANCA
BIANCA	No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	I heard there was a poetry reading.
I heard there was a poetry reading.	You 're so --
You 're so --	Pleasant?
Wholesome.	Unwelcome.
Unwelcome.	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.	Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.	So what did I have an effect on ?
So what did I have an effect on ?	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.	C'mon.  It's not that bad
C'mon.  It's not that bad	Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.	You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?	Maybe.
The Partridge Family?	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.	Good call.
Good call.	So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?	I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?
So what's your excuse?	Acting the way we do.
Acting the way we do.	Yes
Yes	I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.	So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?	Something like that
Something like that	Then you screwed up
Then you screwed up	How?
How?	You never disappointed me.
You up for it?	For. . . ?
State trooper?	Fallacy.
Fallacy.	The duck?
The duck?	Hearsay.
Hearsay.	I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.	I hate peas.
I hate peas.	No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.

What?	No one else knows
No one else knows	You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?	Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?	You know what I mean
You know what I mean	No.
No.	No what?
No what?	No, I won't go with you
No, I won't go with you	Why not?
Why not?	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?	You tell me.
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	Answer the question, Patrick
Answer the question, Patrick	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?	It's just something I had.  You know
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
Oh huh	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .	What?
What?	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!	It wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that.	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?	I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Because I like to torture you.
Because I like to torture you.	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?	Don ' t you even dare. . .

This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?	Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS	Then tell them I had a seizure.
Then tell them I had a seizure.	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?	I thought you were punishing me.
I thought you were punishing me.	Why can't we agree on this?
Why can't we agree on this?	Because you're making decisions for me.
Because you're making decisions for me.	As a parent, that's my right
As a parent, that's my right	So what I want doesn't matter?
So what I want doesn't matter?	You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?	No, Daddy.
No, Daddy.	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	Parts of it.
Parts of it.	Which parts?
Which parts?	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.	Bianca did what?
Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?	No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.	When I go?
When I go?	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?	"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.
Hi.	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?	Yeah.  I guess.
You think?	Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?	Right.
Right.	Kat a fan, too?
Kat a fan, too?	Yeah...
Say it	What?
What?	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.	So Dorsey can get the girl?
So Dorsey can get the girl?	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?	We're your guys.
What?!	Good enough.
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"	Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?	Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.	I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
Sweet love, renew thy force!	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.	With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
Touch of the flu.	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?	What's to discuss?
What's to discuss?	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.	See you next week!
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?	Tumescent!
Tumescent!	You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?	Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap	Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
Your daughters went to the prom.	Did I have anything to say about it?
Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.	That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child...	We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?	I am, Your Eminence
I am, Your Eminence	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.	Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.	Your life, and that of others!
Your life, and that of others!	If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...	The Judgment is ours!
The Judgment is ours!	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.	I know.
I know.	I haven't given you much of a life.
I haven't given you much of a life.	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...	Are we going to argue?
Are we going to argue?	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...	I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.	Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
I don't want you to wait for me.	That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
You don't usually ask.	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...	They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me...	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.	May I ask by whom?
May I ask by whom?	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.	Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.	Appointment to what?
Appointment to what?	Viceroy of the West Indies.
Viceroy of the West Indies.	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
There'll be a time.	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.	This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
Father...	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...	No?
No?	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.	I'm not bargaining!
I'm not bargaining!	Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.	What...?  Do I have so many already?
What...?  Do I have so many already?	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.	Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.	Look out of that window.
What do you see?	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...	All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?	Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell the Chief we thank him.	Chief knows.
Chief knows.	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
Thousands.	Why?
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says -- he has a God.	... and also to bring medicine.
... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
Chief says...	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?	He understands.
He understands.	Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!	You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.	You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!	That's what it says.
That's what it says.	How did you manage it?
How did you manage it?	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.	How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain?	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...	Esdras is a Jew.
Esdras is a Jew.	So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...	Father Marchena!
Father Marchena!	Passion is something one cannot control!
Passion is something one cannot control!	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!
Colon!	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies!	Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.	How long?
How long?	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.	You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.	I knew you would.
I knew you would.	New worlds create new people.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
Oh?  So you are a new man?	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
What did they say about Granada before today?	That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."	A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.	Thank you.
Thank you.	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?	We don't need to know.
We don't need to know.	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?	You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...	God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...	And what do you think Mendez?
And what do you think Mendez?	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.	Come over here.
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
What's he doing?	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.	We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!	Six days ago, yes.
Six days ago, yes.	You must be mad...!
You must be mad...!	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!	You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?	We're lost!
We're lost!	The land is there.  I know it!
The land is there.  I know it!	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?	You bloody...
You bloody...	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!	You tell that to them!
You tell that to them!	You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?	Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?	He must be replaced.
He must be replaced.	And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.	Then why?
Then why?	Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.	Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?	He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
Where are we going?	I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.	You bring the cigarettes?
You bring the cigarettes?	Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.	I was all of these.
I was all of these.	Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.	What about Oleg?
What about Oleg?	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.	No, he is here.  Shit...
No, he is here.  Shit...	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?	Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.	What's your cut?  How much?
What's your cut?  How much?	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.	No.  No way.
No.  No way.	But it's...
But it's...	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.	This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.	What else do you need?
What else do you need?	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.	Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.	Your mother was blind?
Your mother was blind?	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.	Back in the Czech Republic?
Back in the Czech Republic?	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.	Can I see your back?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.	Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	I will if they don't send me back.
I will if they don't send me back.	They won't until this is over.
Are you married?	Divorced.
Divorced.	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.	So...the station is empty?
So...the station is empty?	Yeah.  This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
Yes, I considered it.	Did you ever turn tricks before?
Did you ever turn tricks before?	No.
No.	What about back home?
What about back home?	No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	So you were never a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?	What are you asking me?
What are you asking me?	I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	I know.
I know.	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?	They're not gonna send you right back.
They're not gonna send you right back.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.	I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend?	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.	If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.	I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.	Right.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.	I'll make some for us.
I'll make some for us.	I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?	Pouring it out!
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?	I don't want to drag you down with me.
I don't want to drag you down with me.	Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.	Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
It was my decision, not his.	Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.	Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.	Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin?	Who do you think, Chief?!
Who do you think, Chief?!	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.	What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'	I let her take a shower.
I let her take a shower.	A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?	No!  Nothing happened.
No!  Nothing happened.	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her?	Okay.  But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.	End my career?
End my career?	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.	But Chief?  Over this??
But Chief?  Over this??	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.	What was that, Korfin?
What was that, Korfin?	I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.	You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?	Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic.	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I'm gonna propose.	When?
When?	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.	You ready?
What's he looking for?	A timer.
Where is she?	Takin' a bath.
Takin' a bath.	Any I.D.?
Any I.D.?	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Yeah.	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.	Stay with her.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What's wrong?	We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?	No.
No.	Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.	Describe him.
Describe him.	Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
No, what is it?	Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
Watch the news?	Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, I musta missed it.	Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.	Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.	Nah, why should you?
Nah, why should you?	I don't even watch TV.
I don't even watch TV.	Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
Pretty.	Hmmmm.
Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.	Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her?	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.	This isn't homicide school.
This isn't homicide school.	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.	You're Polish?
You're Polish?	My folks are.
My folks are.	Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?	You got any better ideas?
You got any better ideas?	Mind if I ride along with you?
Mind if I ride along with you?	This has nothing to do with your fire.
This has nothing to do with your fire.	But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.	I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.	Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty?	I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.	So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.	Of course.
Of course.	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?	I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.	Is that all there is?
Why not?	Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.	You wanna talk to her alone?
You wanna talk to her alone?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What would your girlfriend think of that?
What would your girlfriend think of that?	I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.	My point exactly.
My point exactly.	I'm serious here.
I'm serious here.	So am I.
So am I.	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?	You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.	Hey.  I'm a professional.
Hey.  I'm a professional.	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.	Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.	Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.	But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?	You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
So...who's Nicky?	What do you want?
What do you want?	Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.	What's your accomplishment.
What's your accomplishment.	I kill someone famous.

Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!
Sit down!	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!	Good idea!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!	Cut!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?	Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!

I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!	Be quiet.  Watch.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.	Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.	Credit?

Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.

Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.	Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?
Clean?	Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.	But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.	He knew all along.
He knew all along.	What??
What??	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What?	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.	Yeah?
Yeah?	Maybe you can be his stand-in.

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.	Your doctor?
Your doctor?	Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED	She's wonderful.
CONTINUED	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
Right. Just a sec.	Okay.
Okay.	Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.	Sure, what is it?
Sure, what is it?	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.	What's up?
What's up?	It's about my salary cheques.
It's about my salary cheques.	Yes?
Yes?	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.	Really.
Really.	Yes.
Yes.	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.	It's possible.
It's possible.	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.	No. I never did, either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.	Oh?
Oh?	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.	That seems very unlikely.
That seems very unlikely.	Yes, I thought so.
Yes, I thought so.	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.	How?
How?	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.	That's true.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.	But not completely inconceivable?
But not completely inconceivable?	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.	I guess it isn't.
I guess it isn't.	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going?	Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake?	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.	You're kidding.
You're kidding.	No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?	Two more.
Two more.	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal?	Yes.
It's the last one.	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.	I guess not.
I guess not.	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.	Roger.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.	He's got a point.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.	What is it, Hal?
What is it, Hal?	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.	Sure, Dave, what's up?
Sure, Dave, what's up?	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?	Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.	You probably also know that we found them okay.
You probably also know that we found them okay.	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.	Well, don't worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.	And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?	Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.	The antenna has to be replaced.
The antenna has to be replaced.	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I am prepared to do that anyway.	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
CONTINUED	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED	Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED	Well, what is it?
CONINUED	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.	Are you coming to my party?
Are you coming to my party?	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.	When are you coming home?
When are you coming home?	In three days, darling, I hope.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.	Where is Mrs. Brown?
Where is Mrs. Brown?	She's in the bathroom.
She's in the bathroom.	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.	How many days until you come home?
How many days until you come home?	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?	Yes, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.	Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.	I'll bet it's a fortune.
And your charming little daughter?	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.	How is gregor?
How is gregor?	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.	Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.	Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.	Please, it really doesn't matter.
Please, it really doesn't matter.	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?	Yes, very pleasant.
Yes, very pleasant.	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?	Fine.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.	Yes, it's coming along very well.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
Are you quite sure?	Yes, really, thank you very much.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.	Really?
Really?	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?	That's right.
That's right.	I see.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.	Fortunately, they did.
Fortunately, they did.	Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?	Certainly.
Certainly.	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.	Any clue as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Any ideas about the colour?	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.	When do we arrive at Clavius?
When do we arrive at Clavius?	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you.	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.	I see.
I see.	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.	I will if I can, Frank.
I will if I can, Frank.	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?	True.
True.	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?	That's true.
That's true.	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?	That's true
That's true	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?

Yes, Hal, what's up?	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Yeah?	I want to pick up my car.
Name?	Hammond.
This is three years old.	Yeah, I've been busy.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.	How about chargin' the battery?
How about chargin' the battery?	That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.	Great, just great.
Yeah.	Vodka.
Vodka.	Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.	Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.	I don't give a shit who you ask.
I don't give a damn about his girl...	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.	You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile.	I ain't tired yet.
I ain't tired yet.	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.	Whaddya mean, buy?

Pay money?	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.	I never paid for it in my life.
I never paid for it in my life.	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.	He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what about me?	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
I'm candy...	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?	Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

What's the matter with my place?	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...	Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again.	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here you go, baby.	Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?	Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?	Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
How about it?	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
I hear you've got visitors.	Would you guys...
Would you guys...	No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...	You're gonna help us take him.
You're gonna help us take him.	No chance.
No chance.	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Where's ganz?	In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...	I don't think you're gonna make it.
I don't think you're gonna make it.	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.
You're done.  End of story.	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?	Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Yeah, I noticed...	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah?	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.	You're crazy.
You're crazy.	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?	I got a lot to protect.
I got a lot to protect.	Bullshit.
Bullshit.	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.	I'll think about it.
This prison gives out $400 suits?	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.	No way to start a partnership.
No way to start a partnership.	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Yeah.	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?	Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.	Luther was part of the gang?
Luther was part of the gang?	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?	I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.	Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....	I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.	I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Want to try it again?
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.
I think you better put him on ice, man.	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.	If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.	"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.	We eat when I say we eat.
We eat when I say we eat.	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...	Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.	Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict?	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.	Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.	You have a good time?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Well?	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.	This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?	If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...	But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...	You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet?	I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.	That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.	What are you talkin' about?
What are you talkin' about?	You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.	The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?	While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.	Must be billy's girl.
Must be billy's girl.	Come on.
Let's go.	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.	You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...	I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?	Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.	They saved your ass, convict.
They saved your ass, convict.	One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?
How much?	Half a million.
Half a million.	Jesus.
Just tell me about the money.	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.	He's after your money.
He's after your money.	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
We split 50-50?	Not likely, convict.
Not likely, convict.	You gonna let me keep any of it?
You gonna let me keep any of it?	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Where's the money?	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Yeah.  Right.
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.	You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.	Shit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
What?	Musta got some primo bondsman.
Musta got some primo bondsman.	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.	Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
If they don't tell me what I need to know...	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...	You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...	Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.	What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.	No class...
No class...	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?	Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.	You stay with me...
You stay with me...	No way...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Where's luther?	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.	Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?	What about Ganz?
We missed.	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."	So you took the rest of the night off...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...	You sure that's the reason?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...	Yeah. Guess not.
Yeah, I see her.	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.	Why?
Why?	Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Hey, how'd my car get here?	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
It's late, they're closing...	Don't worry about it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...	Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do I get to kiss her too?	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Hey, there she is...	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.	If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.	Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.	Partnership?
Partnership?	Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay?	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.	Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.	There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?	That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.	No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Thanks.	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.	Yeah, I read the report...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah...	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.	Jack?
Jack?	Yeah?
Yeah?	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.	I'll keep it in mind.
What the bell happened?	I lost them, that's what happened.
I lost them, that's what happened.	How did they get away?
How did they get away?	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.	You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up.	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?	I didn't have the time.
I didn't have the time.	Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
That's what you say, Cates...	Yeah.
Yeah.	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.	I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.	Shit.
Billy Bear...	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who are all these?	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.	Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?	Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.	Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.	One of  em's in the slam.
You look awful.	So do you...been a long day.
So do you...been a long day.	Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.	Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.	Doesn't look like it.
Doesn't look like it.	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?	Nothing.
Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.	What?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop...	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.	You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.	Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.	I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.	When? How?
When? How?	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded...	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?	I still don't think it's loaded.
Hey, you're right.	You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
What'd you do?	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I guess he got the message...
I guess he got the message...	Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.	Hey, you know what I really think?
Hey, you know what I really think?	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
That's the way I see it, too.	Call me later.
Call me later.	You sure you want me to?
You sure you want me to?	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...	Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.	Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, one of my favorites.	You made the front page.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...	Jack, are you okay?
Jack, are you okay?	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...	Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...	I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.	No wonder you're so popular.
No wonder you're so popular.	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.	So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?	Jack?  What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...	Jack, wait...
Jack, wait...	Just a second, that's all!
Hello.	Hi, it's me...
Hi, it's me...	Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.	Hiya, kid.
Hiya, kid.	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...	How do you know?
How do you know?	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.

Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	So what?
So what?	When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.	Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Whaddya think?	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.	Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Three more hours...	Where is he?
Where is he?	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...	Tell me.
Tell me.	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
You're impossible...	That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you?	Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...	Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
How would you know?	Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey, two days with him is enough.	That's no bull.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hey...	Shut up.
Shut up.	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.
Stall.	What do you want?
Keep stallin'.	Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they?	Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'?	Can't complain.
Can't complain.	We got a lot to talk about.
We got a lot to talk about.	Yeah, old times.
Yeah, old times.	We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?	Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther.	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-	I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.	You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...	Don't give me this, we were partners.
Don't give me this, we were partners.	Billy, go ahead, break it...
Billy, go ahead, break it...	No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.	When?
When?	I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.	You chickenshit punk...
You chickenshit punk...	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.	You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Let her go.	First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much?	This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...	Don't mess with me. How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?	Five bills.
Five bills.	Five.  On credit.
Five.  On credit.	This ain't a credit business.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.
Give it back.	Try and take it.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..	Corn-i-Lius?
Corn-i-Lius?	At your service.
What're you laughing about?	Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!	The case was stolen?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!	You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!	I'm fucked!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.	Why?  What's wrong with me?
Why?  What's wrong with me?	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...would you like a drink?	No thank you.
No thank you.	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!	They are robots!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You are a monster, Zorg!	I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?	She dropped in on me... holding this.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
I brought the girl remember?	The girl?
He's a she!	You noticed...
You noticed...	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!	So you do know her.
So you do know her.	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
They all like this in your family, father?	She's an exception..
She's an exception..	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.	I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?	"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
"It means, ""Never without my permission""."	That's what I thought.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..	What kind of mission?
What kind of mission?	We have to save the world.
We have to save the world.	Good luck..
Good luck..	Of course.
Of course.	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
What are you doing?	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.	Leeloo's in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?	When is she not in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?	That's what I'm saying.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.	One more reason to shoot first eh?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.	And then?
And then?	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Is there anything that can stop it?	Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.	Thank you, Mr. President.
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!	What is?
What is?	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
What's she doing?	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..	Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...	I didn't know your size.
They really made her...	Perfect.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Where's Leeloo?	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...	Who?
Who?	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Leeloo... is... she's...	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!	Do you love her?
Do you love her?	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!	I don't have time... I need to know.
I don't have time... I need to know.	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.	I would like to have died in peace...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...	They are... with me...
Yeah?	Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.	I was talking to the cat.
I was talking to the cat.	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
At least, the cat comes back.	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.	I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.	Don't exist bud.

I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...	How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Is that him?	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.	Move it, dirtbag... !
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.	Fuck off.
... sorry...	First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?	You betrayed us.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?	Call me Tom.
Call me Tom.	Alright, Tom.
Alright, Tom.	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...	There are reasons for the way we do things here.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.	Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.	Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?	I figured you share information.
I figured you share information.	We do.
We do.	For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.	Why don't they come to me?
Why don't they come to me?	This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

I'm not so sure about this.
I'm not so sure about this.	They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.	I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.	Any good?
Any good?	It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.	You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?

Eddie.	Yeah, who's this?
Yeah, who's this?	I know what you did.
I know what you did.	What?
What?	I know what you did.
I know what you did.	Who is this.
Who is this.	You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...	What the fuck are you.. ?
What the fuck are you.. ?	You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What's he talking about?	One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
I'm gonna kill you.	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.	How'd you find me here?
Don't ask questions.	Fuck you!
Starting to recognize a pattern?	What do you want?
What do you want?	Who is Machine?
Who is Machine?	I don't know...
I don't know...	I want his name.
I want his name.	I told you, I don't know.
I told you, I don't know.	I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.	What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.	Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.	Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.	Yeah.
Yeah.	How much did he pay you?
How much did he pay you?	Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.	That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?	It was a lot of fucking money.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.	Something like that.
Something like that.	What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?	What the fuck do you want from me?
What the fuck do you want from me?	I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!	Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.	Why?
Why?	Because we're going there.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.	You enjoy it?
You enjoy it?	Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.	Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.	What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...	Nobody saw you bring her in?
Nobody saw you bring her in?	There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.

What did you do with her body?	Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.	Show me.
Keep moving.	Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...	Stop talking.
Stop talking.	You got absolute zero.
You got absolute zero.	Show me where you buried her.
Show me where you buried her.	I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.	Where?  Show me where.
Where?  Show me where.	I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Do it.	Don't think I won't.
Don't think I won't.	Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?	Easy enough for you.

You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?

Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.	I'm listening.
I'm listening.	As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.	Of what sort?
Of what sort?	You are a private investigator?
You are a private investigator?	That's right.
That's right.	Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.	Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.	So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.	That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.	Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.	I was well compensated.
I was well compensated.	That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?	Never mind how I found you.
Never mind how I found you.	Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...	They're no friends of mine.
They're no friends of mine.	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.	Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...	Shut up.
Shut up.	Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.	Shut your mouth and drive!
Shut your mouth and drive!	Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You're making me very angry.	Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?	You're asking me why?
You're asking me why?	I'm asking.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...	Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?	Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?	Enlighten me.
Enlighten me.	Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You almost went over your limit.	Fuck you.
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.	Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
He's lying.	Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Big date tonight?	Yeah... guess so.
Yeah... guess so.	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?	Pardon me?
Pardon me?	My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.	Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.	It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.	I'll risk it.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.	Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Truman Capote.	I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.

Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.	Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Remember me?	Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.	Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.	Good for you.
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
Three, four years.	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?	Max.

Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.	"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
... Hello... ?	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.	Interesting theory.
Interesting theory.	What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.	Child pornography.
Child pornography.	There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.

What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?	First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
How old are you?	Twenty-five.

"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""	"""Devil"" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite."

What's this?	It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...	It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.
Uh huh, pleasure.	Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?	Thank you.
He's odd.	He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.	You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.	My condolences.
My condolences.	His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.	I'll do whatever I can to help.
Pittsburgh?	Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.	He succeeded.
He succeeded.	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?	I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.	Just curious.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.	You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.	There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...	Do you want to tell me what you found?
Do you want to tell me what you found?	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't...
I'm afraid I don't...	This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...	"Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...	No.
No.	If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...	I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm telling you it's not that.	I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.	Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?	Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You... you need to go to the police.	I told you I can't, not yet.
I told you I can't, not yet.	You don't have any other choice.
You don't have any other choice.	No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...	It won't work like that.
It won't work like that.	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...	You've found missing persons before.
You've found missing persons before.	Nothing remotely like this.
Nothing remotely like this.	I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Okay...	My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.	I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm not positive this means anything.	The checks were for odd amounts...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...	Okay, I follow you so far...
Okay, I follow you so far...	Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.	You're joking.
You're joking.	To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Hello... ?	I'm here.
I'm here.	Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Do you think the film could have cost that much?	For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.	Okay.
Okay.	Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?	You told me to look, so I looked.
You told me to look, so I looked.	You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Hello?	Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.	How are you?  Having any luck?
How are you?  Having any luck?	I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?	I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.	I hope it's nothing serious.
I hope it's nothing serious.	Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?	I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.	Fine...
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.	How will I get it to you?
How will I get it to you?	If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes... ?	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.	I don't understand, who are... ?
I don't understand, who are... ?	I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?	Yes, but...
Yes, but...	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...	Neil... Neil Cole.
Neil... Neil Cole.	Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?	No.
No.	Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.	They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?	That's exactly what I am.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?	No.
No.	She just seemed... depressed... ?
She just seemed... depressed... ?	She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.	What was she running from?
What was she running from?	I don't know.
I don't know.	If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?	Yes.
Yes.	September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.	We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...	Why do you think he did it?
Why do you think he did it?	It got to be too much for him.
It got to be too much for him.	You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?	There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...	I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to...	You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.	I had to ask.  I apologize.
I had to ask.  I apologize.	No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?	Of course.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...	Okay.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.	We're all like that.
We're all like that.	Are you religious?
Are you religious?	No.
No.	You should be.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.	What?
What?	It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

There wasn't one.  The police looked.	Do you think the police did a good job?
Do you think the police did a good job?	I don't know.  I think so.
I don't know.  I think so.	It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...	No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...	If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
How... how can you say that to me...?	Will you let me look?
Will you let me look?	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?	Yes.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.	It's been six years.
It's been six years.	What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Hello... ?	Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...	I remember.  You just left...
I remember.  You just left...	I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
What are you talking about... ?	She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...	What... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.	Who is this... ?
Who is this... ?	Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...	Who are you?
Who are you?	They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...	No...
No...	He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...	No... no... no...
No... no... no...	They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...	Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?	They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Yes... I remember Mary	You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...	Yes.  I remember her.
Do you know what happened to her?	I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
What is this?	Those are her belongings.
Those are her belongings.	Her belongings?
Her belongings?	That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?	She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...	None too discreet, is he?
None too discreet, is he?	No, sir, he is not.
No, sir, he is not.	He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.	Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Okay, I'll take it all.	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.	Cash.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?	No, you may not.
No, you may not.	Okay.  Fine.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...	Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.	Certainly, sir.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?	What?
What?	The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.	I don't want to.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.	Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Rick...I can't.	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Alice, you think you can leave?	What's wrong?
What's wrong?	Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.	What?
You alright?	Kristen...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?	It was bad.
It was bad.	Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?	I can't find him.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.	It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.	Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I can't go back to sleep again.	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
We'll figure it out.	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.	Then we'll stay up together.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.	Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.	I'm sure they're around.
I'm sure they're around.	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.	You could do worse.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?	Sounds like a game show host to me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.	No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.	Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.	How'd you learn so much about dreams?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You what?	When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Kristen, what happened?	You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
You in a hurry?	I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.	I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.	I know.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
We have matching luggage.	What?
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?
That obvious, huh?	Then you saw him, too?
Then you saw him, too?	Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
No...	You're his sister, right?
You're his sister, right?	Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.	Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.	I know.  Uh...Alice.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.	It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...	"""In her dream""?"
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!	Kristen's story really got to her.
I've been working double shifts.	Extra money, huh?
Extra money, huh?	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.	The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
How long have you been awake?	Three days.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Not really.	Is there something we can do?
Is there something we can do?	I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.	Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?	Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.	Then what else can we do?
Then what else can we do?	Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.	Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.	You just feel sorry for me.
You just feel sorry for me.	Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.	You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
What the hell was that?	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
Rick, please.	Alright, I think I see salvation...
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.	It was Freddy.
It was Freddy.	Enough of that crap.
Enough of that crap.	I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice...	Earth to Alice...
Hey, Rick!	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?	She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.	So?
So?	It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.	Nice neighborhood.
Nice neighborhood.	Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Hey man, we're all sorry...	She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice.	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.	She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.	About Freddy?
About Freddy?	What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Something the matter with the cuisine?	Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.	You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
What's wrong with me?	Your distraught.  It'll help...
I'm sorry honey, but...	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!	Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.	Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Something wrong with the stairs?	Avoid-all-contact-day.
Avoid-all-contact-day.	What?
What?	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.	It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later.	It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.	It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.	I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?	You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
You just stay put.  You need rest.	You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...	Don't worry, honey
Excuse us, dear.	It's okay, Dan
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?	What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.	And ours.  It's our grandchild.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --	"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.	You're not taking my baby!
Hey...wake up.	Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?	It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.	My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
How did you know that?	I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?	Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?	No...
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.	She doesn't want me around
She doesn't want me around	Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?	Who said I...wait, what?
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...?	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?	It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
But how...?	He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
Jesus!  Don't do that!	Sorry, babe.
The tickets.	They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!	I know.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
About him?	No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.	Yeah...I guess.
Yeah...I guess.	You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...	You're right.
You're right.	There you go.  Love you.
There you go.  Love you.	Me too.
I was afraid you weren't coming.	"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."	That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.	No.  A deal's a deal.
Dad!	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?	It's just across the park.
I'm so sorry, honey...	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
How was the meeting?	Sobering...
Sobering...	Very funny.
Very funny.	Alice...
Alice...	Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?	Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...	You disappointed in me?
You disappointed in me?	No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Alice!	I've got to go.
I've got to go.	No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.	But Dad --
But Dad --	Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.	Had kind of a long night.
Had kind of a long night.	Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.	No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.	Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.	Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?	There aren't any little boys on your floor.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.	He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Did everyone call everyone?	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.	No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?	Why don't you two stick to reality.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?	I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...	Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.	Krueger is reality.
Krueger is reality.	And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!	What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?	Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...	That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?	Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But how are we gonna --	We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
He sure loves to stay awake.	That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I thought about that.	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out!	Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?	Nobody thinks that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.	It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.	Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob?	My baby!
My baby!	What, you named it already?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?	I don't know!
Where are you going?	I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.	Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.	Meaning?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.	But I've seen her grave.
But I've seen her grave.	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Poor woman...	No shit.
I don't understand.	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?	My undying love.  Have some.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!	Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.	You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.	Who?
Who?	Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.	I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...	Yeah...
Yeah...	That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.	Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?	Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.	Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.	All of us.  Right?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.	Two hours a day, six days a week.
Vomit?	Faint.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!	Mark...
Mark...	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!	I can't listen to this.
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.	It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.	How is he - ?
How is he - ?	It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.	And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
You could train someone else.	Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
What is it?	Your 'out.'  This came for you.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.	My father!  He's not - ?
My father!  He's not - ?	Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'	Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!	<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...	We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!	That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!	You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?	Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!	You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?	Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!	You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Unidentified Flying Objects.	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !	- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -	I'd sooner swim!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -	Yes?
Yes?	Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.	But if they <u>do</u>?
But if they <u>do</u>?	I don't know.
I don't know.	I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -	And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -	But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!	Helen.  I appeal to you -
Reef!	So they caught up with you, too?
So they caught up with you, too?	At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -	<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?	What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?	Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!	Huh?
Huh?	I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?	I guess.
I guess.	One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.	So?
So?	So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'	A lot of people think like that.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.	Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?	'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Cyclops?	Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We're stuck tight!	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --	'Us?'
'Us?'	Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.	Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.	What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!	I think you're right.
I think you're right.	Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah?	Listen!  Hear that?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -	Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!	You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!	Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?	The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?	Somewhere down there?
Somewhere down there?	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?	We'll have to look for them later.
Well?	I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.	Oh it does???
Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.	Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...	What about down?
What about down?	I...don't know!
Course and speed?	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!	What???
What course, Skipper?	Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --	The frogmen?
The frogmen?	With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --	Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.	We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper---	Yes, Griff?
Yes, Griff?	All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?	Something wrong?
Something wrong?	The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!	What????
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!	Wonderful!
Wonderful!	That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...	Anything ---
Anything ---	It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.	What about time...?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?	Under <u>water</u>?
Under <u>water</u>?	High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.	Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!	What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?	<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....	The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?	If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!	What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole...	There's got to be an explanation!
There's got to be an explanation!	There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready?	As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.	I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.	I met Dr. Kent, once.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.	Who with?
Who with?	Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?	Huh?
Huh?	It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
What do you think?	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.	After torpedo room:  Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?	Take a look.
What's the running time?	Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?	That's what I said!
That's what I said!	But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?	We can <u>ram</u> him!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....	It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.	And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?	What?
What?	If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?	Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!	Come where?
That's a <u>face</u>???	Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.	Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -	- for horrors like yourself?
Swell!	Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!	I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?	On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.	Why?
Why?	I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.	That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?	Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?	Obviously.
Obviously.	<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.	Thank you.
See what?	The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.	Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!	Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.	But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.	All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.	Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?	No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade?	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.	Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	Always has been.
Always has been.	This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.	Who?
Who?	Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.	Who?
Who?	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.	Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.	You don't believe me?
You don't believe me?	About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?	I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.	Has anybody offered to buy it?
Has anybody offered to buy it?	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?	I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

Twombley involved?	No.
No.	He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.	All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --	Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.	-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.	Yeah. I know about that.

Tell me.	Chub says you're fired.
Chub says you're fired.	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.	He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.	It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.	I plan to. Soon.
I plan to. Soon.	How soon?
How soon?	This spring.
This spring.	Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.

No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?	Yes.
Yes.	Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.	Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?	Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.

I hear Twombley got shot.	Yeah.
You see it?	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.

Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.	You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.

Guaranteed, eh?	Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?

I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.	Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
Yes.	"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."

Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.	That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.

I'm not saying that.	Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.	Fuck you.
Fuck you.	That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.	Huh?
Huh?	I figured you already heard.
I figured you already heard.	Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.	Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?	You mean Twombley?
You mean Twombley?	Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.	I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.	I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.	You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.	Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.	You want me to follow them to Littleton?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?	Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.	It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.	Something bugging you?
Something bugging you?	Yeah. A few things.
Yeah. A few things.	Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?	I'm fine, fine.
I'm fine, fine.	You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.	You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?	On what you pay me?
On what you pay me?	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.	I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.	So?
So?	He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.	You? Why?
You? Why?	Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.	That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.	What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?	Want to buy?
Want to buy?	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.	I won't. You interested?
I won't. You interested?	Maybe.
Maybe.	You and Mel Gordon?
You and Mel Gordon?	Could be.
Could be.	Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.	You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?	The key, Wade.
The key, Wade.	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!	Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --	Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?	Yeah.
Yeah.	She's grown up some, hasn't she?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?	Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.	Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.	I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?	No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.	We should talk.
We should talk.	We've done all our talking, Wade.
We've done all our talking, Wade.	It's just...
It's just...	Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?	Yeah, lots.
Yeah, lots.	See. Get your boots.
See. Get your boots.	Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...	You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.	Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?	You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?	Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.	Did you get his number?
Did you get his number?	I know who it is.
I know who it is.	Good. Who?
Good. Who?	Mel Gordon.
Mel Gordon.	I still don't understand --
I still don't understand --	From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
For a while.	How's she doing?
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
Okay. She's fine.	You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.	See you tomorrow, maybe.
See you tomorrow, maybe.	You okay?
You okay?	Yeah.
You okay?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm sorry about what I said.	Said what?
Said what?	About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?	Forget it.
Forget it.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.	No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.
Tonight. Let's get together.	Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.	There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.	I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.	...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.	I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.	Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.	Jack doesn't need money.
Jack doesn't need money.	Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.	Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?	No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.	You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.	No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.	But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.	Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.	What way?
What way?	After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.	It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?	I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.	Then... I guess you have to.
Then... I guess you have to.	There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.	Oh, Wade.
Oh, Wade.	I've been thinking about it, that's all.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.	You've been married twice --
You've been married twice --	It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?	Alright. I'll think about it.
Alright. I'll think about it.	Good.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?	Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?	I know your parents.
I know your parents.	I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.	Think they're alright?
Think they're alright?	Of course! I would've heard.
Of course! I would've heard.	How?
How?	I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.	Wade.
What happened?	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?	Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?	I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.	There's a furnace.
There's a furnace.	You're not using it today?
You're not using it today?	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.	Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.	When did she die?
When did she die?	Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.	Can --?
Can --?	Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.	How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.	What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.	Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?

Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--	Hold on!
Hold on!	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.

You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --	Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.	Yes. Here's your ticket.
Yes. Here's your ticket.	You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Who are you?	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?	He's asleep. We were up very late.

It don't look right.	What?
What?	The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.	I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.

The other guy.	Where... how'd you hear that?
Where... how'd you hear that?	CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?

In the living room.	Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?	Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.

Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?	There was something. It happened up your way.
There was something. It happened up your way.	Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.	Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.	No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.	He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.	Who?
Who?	Twombley.
Twombley.	No shit.
No shit.	You think Jack shot him?
You think Jack shot him?	Well, it was an accident.
Well, it was an accident.	They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.	Huh?
Huh?	The night before the shooting.
The night before the shooting.	How was she?
How was she?	Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.

Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.	What happened?
What happened?	A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.	Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.	Get some sleep.
Get some sleep.	I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.	Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?	No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.	What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?	No thanks. I don't drink.
No thanks. I don't drink.	Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?	What about her?
What about her?	Well, do you still plan to get married?
Well, do you still plan to get married?	Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.	Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?	I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.	Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere.	I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.	Which is?
Which is?	That it wasn't an accident.
That it wasn't an accident.	Then who shot him?
Then who shot him?	Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.	Money.
Money.	Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.	They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?	I don't know. You tell me.
I don't know. You tell me.	Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?	Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?	Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.	So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.	A hunting accident is perfect.
A hunting accident is perfect.	Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?	Not particularly.
Not particularly.	Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?	I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.	Yeah.
Yeah.	I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.	Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?	It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?	It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.	And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.	Well, I never heard that one.
Well, I never heard that one.	I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.	That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.	Wade, are you alright?
Wade, are you alright?	But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.	For what?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?	Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.	Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.	Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sure he's busy.	Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.	Alice...
Alice...	Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...	Back at The Fishbowl?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.	I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry, honey.	No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.	Your father never means to be so...
Your father never means to be so...	I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.	Some kids were teasing you?
Some kids were teasing you?	That's not really the point.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.	Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom?	Yes dear?
Yes dear?	I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.	No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.	So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.	Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.

Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?	Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.	That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.	It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.	You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.	Hey, you guys back already?
How was...  ...the ballet?	It was the experience of a lifetime.
It was the experience of a lifetime.	How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice!	Daddy...
Daddy...	Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...	It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!	Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.	Did we warn them off?
Did we warn them off?	Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.	They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.	The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.	Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Do you see the maintenance panel?	Got it.
Got it.	Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.	Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.	Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
It's cut.	cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.	You read my mind.
You read my mind.	Put your pilot on.
Put your pilot on.	He's busy being dead.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.	Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?	Got it.
Got it.	Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel?	We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here.	Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.	No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.	Lemme take a look.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.	Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.	Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
We don't know that.	Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails.	This doesn't make sense.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.	I prefered the terrorists.
I prefered the terrorists.	That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Sir, you threw out page two.	Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?	It was a good ad-lib, sir.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.	Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that?	We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
But they start executing hostages in	I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.	Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?	Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.	Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.	If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?	Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, Mr. President.	Why?
Why?	Because it is my duty.
Because it is my duty.	You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.	My loyalty was never to my country.

Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.	Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.	We're not going to make it.
We're not going to make it.	Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.	Where are we now?
Where are we now?	Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.	No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.	Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.

Stand by.	Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.

Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.	The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.	This is a remarkable aircraft.
This is a remarkable aircraft.	You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.	A dubious distinction, no?
A dubious distinction, no?	I guess it depends on your perspective.
And all these rooms here?	Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.	Thank you.
*                     Please tell me your name.	Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.	And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?	Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.	What do you want with us?
What do you want with us?	Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.
Leave my daughter alone.	Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...	What do you know of my husband?
What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
I know he left you behind.	My husband is a very courageous man.
My husband is a very courageous man.	Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Do you have to be so brutal?	Yes
Yes	Why? Do you enjoy it?
Why? Do you enjoy it?	I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.	How can you? I mean they're people.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.	That was war.
That was war.	So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.	No.
No.	Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.	You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.	Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...	Jim...
Jim...	Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?	You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.	Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.	No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.	Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.	You'll do it?
You'll do it?	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.	Good. Good.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.	You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?	One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!	If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.	Hold on, Alice.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.	Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.	Twenty minutes?
Twenty minutes?	You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.	Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Finally, we can bargain.	I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.	They've gotta be joking.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.	Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?	Gravity.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.	We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...	They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.	Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.	Got it.
I'll not going without my family.	Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
Can't it wait?	No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.	Rose, I don't have time for this.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.	She's a big girl.  She understands.
She's a big girl.  She understands.	How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.	And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what?	What?
What?	I miss you. And I miss her.
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.	I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise.	I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.	This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
How did your speech go?	Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.	Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.	Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.	Both of you.
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.
Flying the plane.	You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	The fax machines.
The fax machines.	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.	No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?	They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.	Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
and if that means negotiating...	You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.	But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?	Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on?	We're under attack.
We're under attack.	Where's my family?
Where's my family?	We're handling it, sir.
One.	But...
But...	Two... THREE. GO!

Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.	Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.	You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....	Thank you for calling the white House...
Thank you for calling the white House...	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.

No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?	He and the NRA don't like the wording.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.	I might still have a few chips left.
I might still have a few chips left.	*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.	This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.	Other way around, sir.
Other way around, sir.	Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
It's bait.  Don't take it.	Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.	Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.	We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.	Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.	Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.	Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit.	How long's it been since you flew, sir?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?	Twenty-five years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!	DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!	We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.	Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.	Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.	Commissioner.
What?	I just wish it was that simple.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.	That just doesn't make any sense.
That just doesn't make any sense.	I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.	I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...	You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
I was reading too.	What's the story?
What's the story?	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Kruger, Sagittarius.	Commissioner, Aquarius.
Did you feel that?	Yes I did...
Yes I did...	Felt like a large asteroid.
Felt like a large asteroid.	Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?	What is it, Mary?
What is it, Mary?	Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Oveur.	Dunn.
Shut down accelerators.	Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.	You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.	You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn.	Sir?
Sir?	You better take this.
Elaine.	Te...!
Te...!	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.	I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong?	Ask Simon.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.	There's nothing wrong with me!
There's nothing wrong with me!	Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.	You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Elaine.	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Elaine, what happened to us?	Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.	Who's that, Ted?
Who's that, Ted?	Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.	And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.	If that's the way you want it.
If that's the way you want it.	That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.	Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted!  What are you...?	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted?	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!
Not now, Elaine!	Ted!
Elaine.	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.	Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, we have to go back.	We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.	Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
What word would you use, Elaine?	The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.	I'd use the word insane.
I'd use the word insane.	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.	Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine!	Ted!
Ted!	Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, what's going on?	Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.	Ted, please be careful.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine.	I mean until we start to burn up.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.	That was very well put, Ted.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.	That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Simon just ejected!	Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.	You mean...
You mean...	That's right -- premature ejection.
That's right -- premature ejection.	What will happen to him, Ted?
What will happen to him, Ted?	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!	Set!
Set!	Now!
Now!	Compute!
Ted, the lever!	Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.	The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.	What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.	I mean for Ted.
I mean for Ted.	You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.	Is that a good sign, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?	Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.	Simon.
Simon.	Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.	And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.	But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.	You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.	I'm so excited, Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.	I guess this is a first for you.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.	Simon, why has he become so... so...
Simon, why has he become so... so...	So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.	Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
I think so.	That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.	Roger.
Simon, what's happening?!	He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.	Can't we change course?
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
My career is shot.	Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.	Maybe.
Maybe.	Simon, what are you saying?!
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.	Yes, sir.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?	We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.	You can do it from up here, Captain.
You can do it from up here, Captain.	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.	Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze."	Negative.
Negative.	That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.	Negative.
Negative.	That's not possible.
That's not possible.	Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.	That's okay, ROK.
That's okay, ROK.	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?	Go ahead.
Go ahead.	You have great tits.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...	Request; life support systems check.
Request; life support systems check.	Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.	Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.	There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?	We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.	I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.	Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?	It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.	No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?	Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?	Scraps.
Scraps.	Can I hold him?
Can I hold him?	Sure.
Sure.	He's a boy dog.
He's a boy dog.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.	We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...	Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.	I don't want to hear that word!
I don't want to hear that word!	Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.	All right.  Here.
All right.  Here.	What...?
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.	I don't want to live anymore.
I don't want to live anymore.	Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.	What?
What?	That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.	You're sure?
You're sure?	I'm sure.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.	How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.	No.  Poached.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.	Just poached on toast.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.	Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.	Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
Sixteen 'C', why?	He's carrying a bomb.
He's carrying a bomb.	A b...
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.	What should I say?
What should I say?	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Captain Oveur?	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.	We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.	Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.	Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.	Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
You folks need any help?	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?	Yes.
Yes.	It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.	Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.	Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I have to see Bud Kruger.	Do you have an appointment, sir?
Do you have an appointment, sir?	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.	All right, it's a matter of death.
All right, it's a matter of death.	Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
Don't try to stop me!	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Are you on the Mercury mission?	That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.	Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.	You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker.	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.	Then Elaine was right.
Then Elaine was right.	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?	Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.	You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.	Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?	Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.	I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.	You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
You've been hurt.	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.	No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Do you want to talk about it.	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.	No.  I mean your relationship.
No.  I mean your relationship.	We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.	Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.	People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.	Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.	Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.	Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.	I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.	That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Ah, won't you sit down?	Thank you. Cream?
Thank you. Cream?	No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.	Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?	Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?	No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.	Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.	But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?	Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.	I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.	I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.	You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.	Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.	That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?	No. I'm all alone.
No. I'm all alone.	Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.	That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.	Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.	Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.	Something about a plane with no pilot?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.	Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.	Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Both pilots!	Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?	Surely you can't be serious.
Surely you can't be serious.	I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?	Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.	Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.	Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?	Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?	I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.	Surely there must be something you can do.
Surely there must be something you can do.	I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
George Zipp said that?	"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""
"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""	Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Can't you take a guess?	Well...not for another two hours.
Well...not for another two hours.	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?	No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?	I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?	That's right.
That's right.	We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?	Yes. Yes, of course.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.	A hospital? What is it?
A hospital? What is it?	It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.	Certainly.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.	Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?	He had fish.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.	Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?	He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?	No.
No.	All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?	Well...
No. No one that I know of.	I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine!	Ted!
Ted!	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	I just don't want to go over it any more.
I just don't want to go over it any more.	I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.	I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.	Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?	It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.	I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.	Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.	Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.	You expect me to believe that?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.	But if you'll just give me...
But if you'll just give me...	It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
What's the matter?	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.	Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.	I love you, Elaine.
I love you, Elaine.	I love you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?	I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.	That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.	But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
You got a telegram from head颅quarters today.	Headquarters!? What is it?
Headquarters!? What is it?	It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.	Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.	Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem?	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!	Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.	A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.	And a little ice.
And a little ice.	And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.	It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?	Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
But Ted, you're the only...	I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Ted...	Yes?
Yes?	I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.	Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.	The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?	Uh-huh.
We have a visitor.	Hello.
We'd better get back now.	Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.	Who wants to be first?
Airsick?	I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.	Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
You promise you'll write.	Every day.
Good-bye, darling.	Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.	So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.	Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.	Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.	Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.	Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?	Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain?	Did you decide on a runway yet?
Did you decide on a runway yet?	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.	You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!	Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's right on the heading.	All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.	Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.	Here.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!	I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!	I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.	I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.	Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.	...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.	We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.	...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.	The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Hi!	I'm Randy.
I'm Randy.	I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.	Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, I'd love to.	Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
Yes?	Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?	Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?	Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?	Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.	Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger.	Huh?
Roger.	Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?	No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.	All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister?	Yes?
Yes?	There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.	Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.	Of course.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.	Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir?	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?	No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...	The cockpit? What is it?
The cockpit? What is it?	It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.	Would you go up, please?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.	Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.	Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?	You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.	The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?	Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.	A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.	I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.	I like my horizons narrow.
I like my horizons narrow.	Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
You okay?	Yeah...
You are Cassandra?	That's right.
That's right.	We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.	She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
In there.	Show me.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?	You don't have squat.
You don't have squat.	You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!	I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?	Lay off, asshole.
Lay off, asshole.	I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
William Harcourt?	Yes...
Yes...	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.	You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.	That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.	This is becoming a serious breach of security.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.	He didn't recognize me.
He didn't recognize me.	It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.	This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Kill them both.	Here?
Here?	Do it!
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.	What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.	I am George.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?	My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?	"That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"", two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium""."
Let's talk Hubley.	His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.	Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.	Nice signal, dickwad!
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?	There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.	The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...	The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?	Yes.
Yes.	Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
What is wrong?	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Well... yes, quite possibly.	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--	Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Nothing?
Nothing?	Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
What is this?	A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Get the picture?	And that fits?
And that fits?	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.	How the hell do you know that?
How the hell do you know that?	A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.	"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."
"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."	I believe I should interview the widow alone.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.	Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.	Did you learn anything?
Did you learn anything?	A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?	She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.	Did you talk to him?
Did you talk to him?	He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...	We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
Why'd I do what?	Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...	My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?	Uh, Matthew...
Uh, Matthew...	Back off, George.
Back off, George.	But I-- .
But I-- .	I'll handle it.
Screw you.	Screw me?  That can't be right.
Tell me.	Your mother mates out of season.
Your mother mates out of season.	That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.
You know that guy?	From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.	How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?	In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?	Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Which one is that?  Raw what?	This is mole.  It's good.
This is mole.  It's good.	I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?	Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?	"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."
"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."	And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.	When will Strader return?
I believe he is probably lying.	Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?	My wife?  She worries about me.
Yeah... I know the routine.	You are married?
You are married?	Was.  Divorced.
Was.  Divorced.	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.	It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.	I appreciate your honesty, George.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
"... and so, and so the doctor says, ""If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?"	In the other man's rectum.
In the other man's rectum.	Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Your health...	Ta ss'trakyona'...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.	You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.	Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
I'm going home.	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Where'd you get this?!!	A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
She's going to divorce me.	George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?	She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
To the... to the beach?	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Stop the car.	Why?
Why?	Please, I must get out here.
Please, I must get out here.	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.	Stop the car!
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.	Thank you.
What was that about?	Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.	Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...	... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.	You must leave me alone on this.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.	The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.	How potent?
How potent?	"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."
"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."	We?  You've taken it?
We?  You've taken it?	We all did.
We all did.	Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?	No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.	Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?	Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--	Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.	No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Uh, George...	Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...	Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Shit!	Ss-ai!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.	It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
What is this?!	... It's Harcourt.
... It's Harcourt.	Harcourt is dead.
Harcourt is dead.	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...	Tell me about it...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.	We can't let him get away.
We can't let him get away.	Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?	Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.	But there's no more drug.
But there's no more drug.	You understand that.  But how many others will?
How do I look?	You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.	What is it?
What is it?	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.	Only holds five.
Only holds five.	Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.	No... two.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.	Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
You think this is the guy who did it?	We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.	Who else can I ask around here?
Who else can I ask around here?	Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.	I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
That where Anderson worked?	Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.	... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.	Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?	For you, anything.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?	Sure.  Just a minute.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?	Ss'kya'ta'.
Ss'kya'ta'.	What's that?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?	Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.	Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, I heard of it.	That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...	Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--	The human?
The human?	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.	That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.	Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
What kind of test?	Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.	Did he find anything?
Yeah, Sykes?	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.	Departmental policy.
Departmental policy.	You?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...	Don't tell me what to think.
Hope their plumbing's the same.	It is.
How can I go?	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.	What?
What?	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--	But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.	Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?	Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest?	Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.	I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
I can't!  Do you mind!	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
This floor's freezing.	Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?	Would you, Sir?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?	Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Movement!	Position?
Position?	Can't lock up...
Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
Talk to me, Hudson.	Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.	Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Okay, let's do it.	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.	Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.	Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.	Say again?  All after incinerators?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.	Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.	Yes.  That follows.
Yes.  That follows.	But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.	That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.	You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?	Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.

It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.	Could it be intelligent?
Could it be intelligent?	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.	How long until it blows?
How long until it blows?	I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
And it's too late to shut it down?	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'll go.	What?
What?	I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.	All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME?	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!	WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley...	She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.	In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop.	Well, thanks, I --
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...	You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Have they located my daughter yet?	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Is she...?	Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Amy.	Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...	I get the picture.
I get the picture.	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.	They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.	You are a head case.  Have a donut.
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out...
Hear me out...	I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?	Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.	I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.	That's right.
That's right.	Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?	It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?	If I go.
If I go.	If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...	Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...	No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...	Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.	That's the plan.  My word on it.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?	Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I hope you're right.  I really do.	I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
That the atmosphere processor?	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.	Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...	That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.	She's right.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.	Why not?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --	They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?	This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --	Bullshit!
You son of a bitch.	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.	What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.	Corporal Hicks!?
Corporal Hicks!?	This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.	You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.	You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.	But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --	Now, wait a second --
Now, wait a second --	You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?	Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.	Sorry to disappoint you.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.	You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.	These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?	We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Still nothing from the colony?	Dead on all channels.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.	It's insured.
What's he scanning for?	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.	Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?	Thirty-eight...simulated.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.	The structure seems intact.  They have power.
One of us?	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
What is it?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Proceed inside.
So.	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.	So?  So?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
I told them to fall back...	They're but off!  Do something!
How do you feel?	All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...	Forget it.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...	Sir?
Sir?	Yes, Hicks?
Yes, Hicks?	Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.	What's the question?
What's the question?	Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?	All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...	...We're coming in.
...We're coming in.	He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.	Alive?
Alive?	Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?	You tell me.  I only work here.
Save it.	Sure, Hicks.
Let's get the fuck out of here!	Not that tunnel, the other one!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!	Are you finished?  You okay?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.	Aye-firmative.
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.	I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
Seventeen meters.	Let's get these things lit.
Well you're not reading it right!	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Let's go!  Let's go!	Fuckin' A!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.	Poor bastard.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?	About seventeen days.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.	We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.	That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
Now many?	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.	But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
They'll get us.	Maybe.  Maybe not.
Maybe.  Maybe not.	Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?	If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
What's this?	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.	Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.	Yeah.  I've noticed.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.	The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.	Let's waste him.  No offense.
It's game time.	Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.	We didn't miss anything.
Locked.	Stand back.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen.	Don't be long, Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?	No.  Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.	Fuck you.
Fuck you.	Anytime.  Anywhere.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?	Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.	Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!	Hudson, give us a break.
It's inside the complex.	You're just reading me.
You're just reading me.	No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Sounds like you, Hicks.	The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Looks like it stung him.	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.	Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...	She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.	Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.	How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.	I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.	Think of what?  We're fucked.
Think of what?  We're fucked.	What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.	Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
They cut the power.	What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...	Just get back here!
Range twenty meters.	Seal the door.
Fifteen meters.	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.	They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Nine meters.  Eight.	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!	It's readin' right.  Look!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?	Yeah.  What?
Yeah.  What?	There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.	Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'

So what do I tell this guy?	Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And how are we today?	Terrible.
Terrible.	Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.	How long have I been on Gateway station?
How long have I been on Gateway station?	Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?	No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say?	Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey.  She's my only friend.	What about me?
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?
Why not?	Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.	They're dead.
They're dead.	Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.	You promise?
You promise?	Cross my heart.
Cross my heart.	And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.	The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?	Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.	You're really something, ace.
I guess we're not leaving, right?	I'm sorry, Newt.
I'm sorry, Newt.	You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.	I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.	Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.	My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.	Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?	No, it's different, honey.
No, it's different, honey.	Did you ever have a baby?
Did you ever have a baby?	Yes.  A little girl.
Yes.  A little girl.	Where is she?
Where is she?	Gone.
Gone.	You mean dead.
Don't go!  Please.	I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.	Wah...?  Where are...?
Wah...?  Where are...?	Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.	I know, honey.  Me too.
Burke!  Open the door!	Look!
Come on.  Crawl faster.	DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?	Sure.  Go left.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!	Newt, wait!
I knew you'd come.	Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Mommy...Mommy?	Right here, baby.  Right here.
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.
That's right.	Can we dream?
Can we dream?	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Look, I told you...	It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...	That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...	Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...	...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Why won't you check out LV-426?	Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.	What are you talking about. What people?
How many colonists?	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.	Sweet Jesus.

Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.	Certainly!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?	Indeed.
Indeed.	These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.

Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.	My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.

You might be disappointed.	Why?
Why?	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.	Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.

What?	The marriage!

Well, what does it matter to you?	Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
How was I? Tell me honestly.	You were sublime.

Extremely clever.	Meaning you didn't like it.

No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
No! I won't have him back.	But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.

We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.	Wolfi.
Wolfi.	Yes, my love?
Yes, my love?	These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!	Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.	What?
What?	Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!	I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Why not? Half the house!	When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.	Oh, Stanzi.
Oh, Stanzi.	I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.	Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.	Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.	Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!	Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Who was that?	No one.
No one.	I heard voices.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?	I'm not telling you.
I'm not telling you.	Why not?
Why not?	You'd think I was mad.
No. Don't answer it!	Why?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?	Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.	Give me two more weeks. Please.
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
I can't write it!	Why not?
Why not?	It's killing me.
Go back to bed.	Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Excellency!	Madame. How can I help you?
Frau Mozart?	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.	How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?	He's terribly busy, sir.
He's terribly busy, sir.	I understand.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.	Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.	I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.	I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.	Really?
Really?	My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.	Then he didn't send you?
Then he didn't send you?	No, sir. This is my own idea.
No, sir. This is my own idea.	I see.
I see.	Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.	That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.	Originals?
Originals?	Yes.
These are originals?	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It is miraculous.	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.	Oh, thank you, sir!
Come back tonight.	Tonight?
Tonight?	Alone.
Alone.	What for?
What for?	Some service deserves service in return. No?
Some service deserves service in return. No?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.	But! I'm a married woman!
But! I'm a married woman!	Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?	What?
What?	Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
What are you doing here?	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.	Why you?
Why you?	I was at hand.
I was at hand.	Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	He needs me, ma'am.
He needs me, ma'am.	No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.	He asked me to stay.
He asked me to stay.	And I'm asking you -
This is not his handwriting.	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.	He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.	Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
How much will you pay him?	Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Am I interrupting something?	Not at all.
Not at all.	Where's our friend?
Where's our friend?	He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.	I hope so. I need it immediately.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?	Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?	He's doing his best.
He's doing his best.	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!	You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?	Money! Money!
Money! Money!	You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.	Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.	When, may I ask?
When, may I ask?	In three months! Papa.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!	Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?	Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!	So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.	Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!	Be careful!
He's adorable!	Adorable!
Behold!	Behold!
Hey!	Hey!
Behold!	Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.	I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.	Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!	I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.	Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.	Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Upstairs.	Gertrude!
Gertrude!	You can't be Herr Mozart!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.	Gertrude!
Gertrude!	It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.	People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.	Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
I said play!	Michael!
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?	I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.	Wine?
Just one year.	Who was your teacher?
Who was your teacher?	I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.	Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.	You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
What a charming idea. May I see?	It's just a trifle, of course.
It's just a trifle, of course.	May I try it?
May I try it?	Majesty.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?	You do me too much honour, Sire.
You do me too much honour, Sire.	Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
A-flat, Majesty.	Ah-ha!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
My pleasure.	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.	Your Highness.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -	Yes?
Yes?	You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.	And the result satisfies.
And the result satisfies.	Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.	Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.	I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.	You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.	Sire.
Sire.	Well. There it is.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.	Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.	Why not?
Why not?	Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.	Oh?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.	Of course not.
Of course not.	I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.	Really?
Really?	As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!	Yes?
Yes?	Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Do you like this, Salieri?	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.	Well, look at them.
Your Majesty!	No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Oh, thank you.	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Majesty!	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Why so?	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.	It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, where?	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.	Ah-ha.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.	What? On one hearing only?
What? On one hearing only?	I think so, Sire, yes.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?	Yes, indeed.
Yes, indeed.	And German?
And German?	Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!	So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.	What do you mean, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.	My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.	Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.	Enchanted, Madame.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?	Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Excuse me, but how old are you?	Twenty-six.
Twenty-six.	Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?	What is it?
What is it?	May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.	Ah! By all means.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?	Yes, Sire.
Yes, Sire.	Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?	Who told you this, Majesty?
Who told you this, Majesty?	It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?	Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, yes, I admit it is.	Would you tell me why?
Would you tell me why?	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.	Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.	I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.	Ah, love again.
Ah, love again.	But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?

I have no idea.	Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!	Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.	You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.	Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?	I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.	Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?	In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
Well, what do you have for me today?	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -	Yes, what about him?
Yes, what about him?	He's here.
He's here.	Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.	I will.
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
Am I not welcome?	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.	Is she not here?
Is she not here?	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Do you always live like this?	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.	Don't you have a maid?
Don't you have a maid?	Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.	How is your financial situation?
How is your financial situation?	It couldn't be better.
It couldn't be better.	That's not what I hear.
That's not what I hear.	What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.	They say you're in debt.
They say you're in debt.	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!	How many pupils do you have?
How many pupils do you have?	Pupils?
Pupils?	Yes.
Yes.	Yes.
Yes.	How many?
How many?	I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.	This one will.
What's that?	Oh, let's not talk about it.
Oh, let's not talk about it.	Why not?
Why not?	It's a secret.
It's a secret.	You don't have secrets from me.
You don't have secrets from me.	It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.	Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
No, really!	This is just a game, Papa.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa, is this your idea?	Mine?
Are you playing a trick on me?	I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!	Papa!
Papa!	Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.	No one calls you that.
No one calls you that.	She does. She says I sleep all day.
Father -	Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.	I will, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?	Yes, thank you, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.	Bene! Bene!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.	Bene.
Oh, thank you, sir.	Do any pupils come to the house?
Do any pupils come to the house?	Not that I've seen.
Not that I've seen.	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?	Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.	Really? What is it he's writing?
Really? What is it he's writing?	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!	Why? What has happened?
Why? What has happened?	You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.	What medicine?
What medicine?	I don't know. He has pains.
I don't know. He has pains.	Where?

Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.	Is he working?
Is he working?	I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.

Opera? Opera!	Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	Are you sure it's an opera?
Yes?	Are you Herr Mozart?
Are you Herr Mozart?	That's right.
That's right.	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.	What?
What?	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?	Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sssh!	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!	Sssh! Stay here.
What did he say? What did he say?	Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well?	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.	I liked the horse.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

Animals?	I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.	German!
German!	Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.	So there you are. What do you say?
Leave that alone!	Wolfi!
Wolfi!	Put it down!
Put it down!	What is this?
What is this?	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.

Yes.	Can I see it?
Can I see it?	No.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	Because there's nothing to see.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.	Well, we can.
Well, we can.	So let me see it. Where is it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.	And which one of them do you want me to teach?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?	What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.	Madame.
Madame.	This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I'm afraid I am.	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?	Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!	Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?	Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?	What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?	What for?
What for?	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.	My answer is no, Mozart.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?	Really?
Really?	Mio caro Adone.
Mio caro Adone.	Ah!
Ah!	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Love, Sire!	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.	But this is absurd!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.	Did you like it, then?
Did you like it, then?	How could I not?
How could I not?	It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.

I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.	So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?

No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!

Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?	No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.	It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me.

I'm afraid not.	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!

Yes.	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
The Fire.	What time?

Yes.	Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?

I think so.	Sing it back.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?	Yes.
Yes.	Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -	Please! Just one moment.
It couldn't be simpler.	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?	With the tenors.
With the tenors.	Also identical?
Also identical?	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
And that's all?	Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Do you have me?	I think so.
I think so.	Show me.
That's wonderful!	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

Exactly.	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.	But, Your Majesty -
That will do, Herr Mozart!	Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.	Certainly, Herr Director.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?	Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.	It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What are you doing, Herr Director?	Taking out what you should never have put in.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?	What is what?
What is what?	Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.	Because His Majesty wishes it.

Herr Mozart -	May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.	Baron!
Mozart -	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?	Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?

Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?	Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?	Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
What do you want?	I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.	About what?
About what?	You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?	So?
So?	In the sight of God that is a sin.
In the sight of God that is a sin.	What do you want?
What do you want?	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.	Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.	Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?	That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.	Are they?
Are they?	Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.	I do not seek forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.	My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.	How well are you trained in music?
How well are you trained in music?	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.	Where?
Where?	Here in Vienna.
Here in Vienna.	Then you must know this.
I can't say I do. What is it?	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Well?	I regret it is not too familiar.
I regret it is not too familiar.	Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?	Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.	Ah - you've heard that?
Ah - you've heard that?	All Vienna has heard that.
All Vienna has heard that.	And do they believe it?
And do they believe it?	Is it true?
Is it true?	Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?	Should I?
Do you hear me?	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.	Did you try?
Did you try?	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.	You cannot say that!
You cannot say that!	No? Was Mozart a good man?
No? Was Mozart a good man?	God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.	All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

My son, no one can speak for God.	Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!	I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
What?	His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?

Yes.
Yes.	The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.	I did.
I did.	No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!	I poisoned his life.
I poisoned his life.	But not his body.
But not his body.	What difference does that make?
What difference does that make?	My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!	Oh my son, my poor son!
Oh my son, my poor son!	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.	Yes?
Yes?	Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.	Italian?
You mean that play?	Exactly.
Exactly.	He's setting that play to music?
He's setting that play to music?	Yes.
Yes.	You must be mad.
Are you absolutely sure?	I've seen the manuscript.
I've seen the manuscript.	Where?
Where?	Never mind.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
Incredible.	The Emperor has given him permission.
What anger?	About the ballet.
About the ballet.	Ballet? What ballet?
Ballet? What ballet?	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?	Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?	Yes, in the third act.
Bravo, Your Majesty!	Well done, Sire!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.	Did we?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?	For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.	Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?	Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.	Ah.
Here I am, my angel.	What? Who the devil are you?
What? Who the devil are you?	I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.	Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.	I can't wait.
I can't wait.	Well, promise then.
Well, promise then.	What do you mean - now?
What do you mean - now?	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?	Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.	I agree, Baron.
I agree, Baron.	Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?	No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.	How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.	Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.	Who is she?
Who is she?	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.	Excuse me, my dear.
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
What does he want?	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.	Come with me. And stay in the room.
Herr Salieri.	Yes, I am looking after him.
Yes, I am looking after him.	Can we come in?
Can we come in?	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.	But he's all right?
But he's all right?	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.	Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?	Of course.
Of course.	And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.	Bene.
Bene.	I'll call tomorrow.
I'll call tomorrow.	Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?	Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?	The American? Yes, duck.
The American? Yes, duck.	How did he look?
How did he look?	What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?	You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?	I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.	Thank you.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.	Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?	Dr. Hirsch?
Dr. Hirsch?	Go about your duties.
Go about your duties.	Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Miss Price?	Yes, Doctor?
Yes, Doctor?	What exactly did he call out?
What exactly did he call out?	He said 'Jack'.
He said 'Jack'.	That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.	What happened to them?
What happened to them?	The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.	No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Did he say a wolf?	Yes, I believe he did.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.	Come to my office, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	It's a full moon. Where is he?
It's a full moon. Where is he?	At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
He's not?	Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?	Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.	Has his friend appeared to him again?
Has his friend appeared to him again?	Yes.
Yes.	What did he say?
What did he say?	David says Jack comes to warn him.
David says Jack comes to warn him.	Warn him?
Warn him?	Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?	I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.

They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.	And what else?
And what else?	I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?	No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Surely you're not suggesting...	David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.	What shall we do?
What shall we do?	Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He's here.	Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?	He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.	The zoo? Is he rational?
The zoo? Is he rational?	Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.	Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?	No, why?
No, why?	Is David acting strangely?
Is David acting strangely?	No, not really.
Could you get here without any trouble?	Yes, I should think so.
Yes, I should think so.	Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?	Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor.	You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?	He's fine. We'll come right over.
He's fine. We'll come right over.	Shall I send a car?
Shall I send a car?	No, a cab will be faster.
No, a cab will be faster.	I expect you shortly.
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.	David?
David?	I doubt it. But it's something to do.
It wasn't a lunatic.	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	It was a wolf.
It was a wolf.	What?
What?	A wolf.
Mr. Kessler?	Yes?
Yes?	You haven't eaten your lunch.
You haven't eaten your lunch.	I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.	I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.	Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.	You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.	How is that?
How is that?	Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?	Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.	Sorry.
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
Call me Alex.	Aw come on, Alex!
Aw come on, Alex!	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me David.	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?	This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.	Right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Will you give me a break?
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.
I thought you were asleep.	I was. What are you reading?
I was. What are you reading?	'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.	Do you like it?
Do you like it?	I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
I dream of death mostly.	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.	It's okay. I want to talk to you.
How old are you?	That's not really a very proper question.
That's not really a very proper question.	How old are you?
How old are you?	Twenty-eight.
Twenty-eight.	I'm twenty-seven.
I'm twenty-seven.	I know.
I know.	Now what do you want to talk about?
Now what do you want to talk about?	Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?	My best friend. My very best friend.
My best friend. My very best friend.	Shall I read to you?
Shall I read to you?	What? Oh, yes, please.
What? Oh, yes, please.	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?	Yes, go on.
Yes, go on.	Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Hello. You all right?	I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm sorry I woke you up.	Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?	No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.	That's easy enough.
That's easy enough.	I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.	David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.	Will you come with me?
Will you come with me?	What?
What?	I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.	Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.	Will you think about it?
Will you think about it?	How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?	Not just a patient -- me.
Not just a patient -- me.	You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?	Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.	All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?	Now I'm embarrassed.
Now I'm embarrassed.	Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
I'm a werewolf.	A werewolf?
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.
I'll let you know the next full moon.	You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?
Your dead friend Jack?	Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?	What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?	I was dreaming again?
I was dreaming again?	I would think so.
I would think so.	Yeah, I would think so, too.
The kitchen.	Very nice.
Closet.	Charming.
Charming.	Bathroom.
Bathroom.	Lovely.
Lovely.	The bedroom.
The bedroom.	There is only one bed.
There is only one bed.	David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
Alex?	Yes?
Yes?	Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?	Of course.
Of course.	Good.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?	I was awake and he was in my room.
I was awake and he was in my room.	But, David.
But, David.	I wasn't hallucinating.
Tomorrow is the full moon.	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.	Do me an enormous favor?
Do me an enormous favor?	Anything.
Anything.	Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.	It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.	Werewolves simply do not exist.
Werewolves simply do not exist.	David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?	Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?	Okay.
Okay.	I've left those pills for you.
I've left those pills for you.	A doper werewolf.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!	I'm freezing.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!	The zoo?
The zoo?	Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?	Don't you remember?
Don't you remember?	I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
The next corner we can get a cab.	I should be committed.
I should be committed.	Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
But...	Pull over.
David, what are you doing?	Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.	David, stop!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...	Jack is dead!
Jack is dead!	Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	What?
What?	We had an argument. He's being silly.
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I swear, I don't know this girl.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...	Will you shut up!?!!
Hopeless. It's hopeless.	David, let's go now.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!	David, don't lose control.
David, don't lose control.	Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Hello, Benjamin.	No.
No.	No what?
No what?	No.
No.	Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.	No.
Feeling better?	No.
No.	The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.	No.
No.	Right.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.
No.	No what?
No what?	No!
No!	Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	No.
No.	I thought not.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.	He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.	Chart says he's from New York.
Chart says he's from New York.	I think he's a Jew.
I think he's a Jew.	Why on earth do you say that?
Why on earth do you say that?	I looked.
I looked.	Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Miss Price.	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.	Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?	Has he been refusing food?
Has he been refusing food?	Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!	There's no call for that kind of language.
There's no call for that kind of language.	Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!	Now see here young man.
Now see here young man.	Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Who is this girl?	You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.	That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?	This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.	Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.	You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.	No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.	Why are you doing this to me?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?	No, but we're about to.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.	Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, come on, tell us.	No. You've had your chance.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.	That's very funny, that is.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!	You could have told them!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.	I was having a nightmare.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.	What time is it?
What time is it?	It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.	Alex?
Alex?	Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.	What are you going to see?
What are you going to see?	An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.	Do you have bad dreams, too?
Do you have bad dreams, too?	Some, everyone does.
Some, everyone does.	Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?	Bambi?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.	Where am I?
Where am I?	You're in a hospital in London.
You're in a hospital in London.	London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.	I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.	The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?	Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!	Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
How long have I been here?	You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.	Two weeks?
Two weeks?	You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.	Lunatic?
Lunatic?	Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
There were witnesses?	So they said.
So they said.	How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.	In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.	Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
You've never had bad dreams before?	Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?	I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.	Yes.
Yes.	Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.	You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.	Did you see Jack?
Did you see Jack?	No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.	Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?	I really don't know.
I really don't know.	Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.	David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.	You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?	Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.	Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Are you cold?	Yes.
Yes.	Good.
Jack.	David.
David.	You're not having a good time are you?
You're not having a good time are you?	Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here.	I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.

I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.	Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...	If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.	I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.	It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.	It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.

We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?	She says she 'likes me too much'.
The Slaughtered Lamb?	Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?	That's a wolf's head.

David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.	I assume full responsibility.
I assume full responsibility.	Okay.
Okay.	Shall we?
Hello.	Nice to see you.
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.	Look at that.
What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
It's a five-pointed star.	Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Ask them what the candles are for.	You ask them.
You ask them.	Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.	I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.	Right.
Right.	Wrong.
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.	What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!	Apparently so.
What the hell was that all about?	I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.	Beware the moon?
Beware the moon?	Come on, I'm freezing.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.	I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.	Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong?	I have no idea.
I have no idea.	Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.	I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Say, David...	I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
I heard that.	What was it?
Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
Yeah?	A coyote.
A coyote.	There aren't any coyotes in England.

I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.	Yeah.
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
I don't know. Come on.	Come on, where?
Come on, where?	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's moving.	It's circling us.
What's the plan?	Plan?
Plan?	Let's just keep walking.
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
Oh shit. What is that?	A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.	Walk away, Jack.
Walk away, Jack.	Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
See anything?	No.
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Where are we going?
Where are we going?	I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll tell you when we get there.	Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
You really scared me, you shithead.	Are you going to help me up?
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.

Thanks a lot.	This is too much. I can't handle this.
This is too much. I can't handle this.	I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.

Hi, Jack.	Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to say anything.	Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?	If I was still alive, I probably would.
If I was still alive, I probably would.	You look awful.
You look awful.	Thank you.
Thank you.	I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.

Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.	I want you to meet some people.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.	Hello.
Hello.	Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
I could hang myself.	If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Dr. Hirsch?	Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor.	Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You were saying?	Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?	Why don't we ask him?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...	Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
What can we do to assist you?	Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Yes?	Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.	Send them in.
Excuse me.  Yes?	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.	What here?
What here?	He's on the telephone.
He's on the telephone.	Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Hello, there. What can I get you?	Campari and soda would do nicely.
Campari and soda would do nicely.	Sorry, love.
Sorry, love.	I suppose Guinness will suffice.
What's that?	Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.	I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Do you have any hot soup?	No.
Hot chocolate?	We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.	Then you have some hot tea?
Then you have some hot tea?	No.
No.	Oh.
Oh.	But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Remember the Alamo?	I beg your pardon?
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
Sorry.	Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.	Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...	And what, Sergeant?
And what, Sergeant?	I don't rightly know, sir.
I don't rightly know, sir.	That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.	We'll find him, not to worry.
Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!	Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?	I want to know why .
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest聴	I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.	But listen, Tom, I聴
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.	She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.	Why not?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?	Yes - sure聴
Yes - sure聴	Yeah - sure!
Oscar, what's the matter?	I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.	No kidding?
No kidding?	No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.	Where's Matt?
Where's Matt?	Matt?
Matt?	Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .	The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.	He has?
He has?	Yeah.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.	How much?
How much?	About twenty-four thousand.
About twenty-four thousand.	It was more than that last week.
It was more than that last week.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Let me have ten bucks?
Let me have ten bucks?	Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.	Charlie!
Charlie!	Yeah?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I聴	Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Whose death?	It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

Where you been?	Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
What's the matter, Charlie?	I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.	I remember once when your account checked.
I remember once when your account checked.	Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.	Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Mr. Dickson in yet?	Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.	When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	And tell him not to delay.
And tell him not to delay.	Yes, sir.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.	Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!	Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust聴
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust聴	What good will that do?
What good will that do?	What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!	Take it easy, Clark.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.	All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything聴	I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.	Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?	Just pure luck!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?	Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.	I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!	Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!	Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
We want to talk to you.	What about?
What about?	We'll discuss that in the board room.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?	What do you mean, help?
What do you mean, help?	I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.	That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?	I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?	Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.	No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish.

So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Say, you can't do that聴	I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.	The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!	We've been waiting fifteen minutes聴
We've been waiting fifteen minutes聴	You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.	Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?	Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?	That's very simple. I was home.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.	Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.	Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?	If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.	Oh!

What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?	They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!	Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.

Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?	I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.	You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?	She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.

Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.	Yes, sir.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?	Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning, Helen.	Good morning.
Good morning.	Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh!	Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?	Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?	Yes, sir.
Yes?	Mr. Sampson . . .
Mr. Sampson . . .	All right. Send him in.
Helen!	Yes?
Yes?	Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.	Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	Got my letter?
Got my letter?	Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.	Hello, Helen.
Mr. Dickson?	Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.	Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?	I haven't any.
I haven't any.	You haven't got a uniform?
You haven't got a uniform?	No, sir.
No, sir.	My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?	Why, I don't know.
Why, I don't know.	You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Oh, make that uniform blue.	Yes, sir.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Looks good. How much did it cost?
Looks good. How much did it cost?	I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
It's all right. Thanks.	And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.	Sure, I think it's swell.
Sure, I think it's swell.	Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.	Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?	Well, I聴
Well, I聴	I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?	I can't tell you.
No. I won't.	You're protecting somebody.
You're protecting somebody.	No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!	Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.	Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?	You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?	Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?	Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?	Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?	Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is聴
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town.

Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?	Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .	She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?	Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and聴
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and聴	All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!	But I haven't . . .
But I haven't . . .	I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.	Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson聴
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.	I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.	Why pick on him ?
Why pick on him ?	It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?	Yes.
What time did this thing happen?	The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.	All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?	If he can do it, yes.
If he can do it, yes.	Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.	Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.	What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.	Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.	So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they聴
Of course it's true - and he knows it.	Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.	Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.	He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You're lying!	Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.	You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Well, Sampson, what is it?	Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.	I'm afraid he's been stalling.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.	That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .	He says he can't get away in the daytime.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.	How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.	Yes, sir.
The lobby's half filled now.	What are you talking about?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.	All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.	We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.	Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.	Did you get the case for the securities?
Did you get the case for the securities?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Mine too?
Mine too?	Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.	What'll we do?
What'll we do?	I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.	Don't you think I know it?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!	Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.	Is it safe?
Is it safe?	Absolutely.
Absolutely.	It's his life insurance money, you know.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.	But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!	Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.	Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?	He's at a board meeting.
He's at a board meeting.	Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.	I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid so.	Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?	No.
No.	Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?	Hardly.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!	All right.
Hello, Helen!	Matt, come here!
Matt, come here!	Why?
Why?	Come here, honey!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!	Oh, is that so?
What did you do with it?	With what?
With what?	The ten dollars.
The ten dollars.	Oh, ten dollars聴
Oh, ten dollars聴	Yes.
Yes.	A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh, you think I'm lying?	Yes.
Yes.	All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.	Oh, Matt.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?	Yeah, swell.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?	Yeah.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.	Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.	Well . . . ?
Well . . . ?	Well, he was making love to her.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.	I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office?	Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.
Oh, Charlie again.	Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?	Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]	Oh now, don't be silly.
Oh now, don't be silly.	Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.	Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.	Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that聴
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.	All right, dear.
Oh, Matt . . .	Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.	They must have turned him down.
They must have turned him down.	Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.	Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Did you talk to him?	Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.	Mr. Williams . . .
Mr. Williams . . .	The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?	Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Did you say Dude Finlay?	Yes, why?
Yes, why?	He was in the bank yesterday.
He was in the bank yesterday.	He was here?
He was here?	He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Yes, sir.
What did you find out, Mike?	I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.	Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?	He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.	Dude Finlay?

聴for the rheumatism, you know.	What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?	It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
What time was it?	Huh?
Huh?	What time did Matt Brown get in?
What time did Matt Brown get in?	Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after聴
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after聴	I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?	That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .	Was it twelve o'clock?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...	It couldn't have been earlier?
It couldn't have been earlier?	No. It wasn't earlier because...
No. It wasn't earlier because...	Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.	No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.	There you are!
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it聴	That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?	wasn't anywhere near this place聴

I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!	You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
So you were home last night?	Yes.
Yes.	What time did you get in?
What time did you get in?	Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.	Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?	Yes.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .	Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.	Okay, Matt.
How are you fixed?	I'm okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.	You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.	Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?	Bought himself a pocketbook!
Everybody in?	I guess so.
I guess so.	Where's Charlie?
Where's Charlie?	Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!	They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.	Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
I couldn't lose him.	Jim Younger, I told you--
This is healing?	Sometimes a wound will kill.
Sometimes a wound will kill.	Now you tell us.

He's smiling.	Never a good thing.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.

The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.	I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.	Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does.	You stay out of this, Bob.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.	How?
How?	"Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."
We got a problem here, brother?	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.	What?
This is the best score yet.	It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.	That was because of... the reputation the gang had.

I'm sorry, Cole.	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
"Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."""	He's not bad at it.
He's not bad at it.	It's tougher than it looks.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.	I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Yesterday.	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Corn gonna shoot at me?	Nope.
Nope.	Then I love it.

Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.	Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.	Oh no...
Oh no...	He just lost his temper a little.
Damn!	They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --	The Army can hang him.
The Army can hang him.	Tomorrow.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.	Best damn plan I heard all war.
How many of them did he kill?	Two.
You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
But if we take their money and supplies...	Exactly.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.	Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.	We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
"""The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."""	Hey!
Hey!	"""Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."""
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...	One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Beg pardon?	You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."	Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...	You are a fine figure of a man.
You are a fine figure of a man.	Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.

What?	You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What you sayin' boy?	I think I recognize you.
I think I recognize you.	How?
How?	I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You shut up now, boy.	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
I could use the walk.	Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
Where you boys going?	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
You're not scared, are you?	Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Not now.	What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?	In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?	She got two of them.
She had a moustache.	She was European!
She was European!	All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Thanks for the help.	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?	The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.	It was exciting.
It was exciting.	But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.	Yeah.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.	So what do we do, General Lee?
So what do we do, General Lee?	Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.	Perfect, Cole.
Perfect, Cole.	Let's ride.
The James-Younger Gang.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Don't let it happen again.
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
See, Frank's being smart about this.	Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
It's not a bank.	It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
"""The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."""	Twenty?!
Jesse, we got to have a word.	Sure, cousin.
Sure, cousin.	"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""	Yep.
Yep.	"Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here."
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.	Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.	What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.	You're forgetting who's in charge --
Beautiful.	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --	A bad idea.
A bad idea.	I got us through the War all right.
I got us through the War all right.	And almost got hanged in peacetime.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.	That's it.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.	And I'm the better outlaw.
Still smells fishy.	Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Fine. We hit this bank.	You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Dammit!	A trap.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Bob, rip up some bandages.	Pass me some whisky.
We'll make them pay for this.	I'm out.
I'm out.	WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!	Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Where'd you get all these riders?	We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!	You ride like a Comanche.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.	Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...	Well?
Well?	I'm thinking...
Cannon or Gatling?	Both would be nice.
Both would be nice.	Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
What the --	Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
Which one, right or left?	The brown one.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...	Sadie was not a man!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.	Shakespeare.  He's European.
Shakespeare.  He's European.	Ah.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!	Get buckets!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --	Strategically.
Strategically.	-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Jesse.	Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?	Cole, he didn't mean that.
Another dozen out back.	They gonna rush us?
They gonna rush us?	They're just insurance in case we run.
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?
Of course!  Uh, sir?	What?
What?	Where is Jesse James?
Where is Jesse James?	This here is the Younger Gang!
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!	All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You 'um big lawman?	Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?	Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.	The District Marshall
Of St. Louis?	Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.	East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?	Ho-yah!
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!	Me get heap firewater --
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
You're right, sir.	Then why can't I go in there?
Then why can't I go in there?	On account of we're robbing it.
On account of we're robbing it.	Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?	It's a secret.
It's a secret.	Fine. I'll just wait here.
Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.
What the --	What is it?
What is it?	Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.	So?
So?	When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Where the hell were you?	I had you covered.  From back there.
I had you covered.  From back there.	Shit.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.	My little Web did that?
My little Web did that?	Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Web died fighting?	Died a hero.
Boys...	Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you say, sir?	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
You know you're welcome any time!	Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.	It's fine by me, Jesse.
Daddy, don't start with this again.	Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?	The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
They're gone. What are you --	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.	Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.	I think he's already feeling better.
He thinks this is some kind of game!	I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.	So we got a plan?
Distracting enough for you?	Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.	So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.	Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.	Such as?
Such as?	You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.	That would have made an impression.
That would have made an impression.	I figure.
I figure.	See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.	No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Web's dead.	I reckoned.
I reckoned.	Hell of a war.
Hell of a war.	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!	All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.	We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
You're doing just fine.	Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.	Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.	Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.	What kind of story are they going to believe?
That just might work.	Maybe, maybe...
"""Big and older""?"	You can shut up now.
You can shut up now.	You are a charmer.
You are a charmer.	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.	"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
She's still talking to Jesus.	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.	"Your Zee? Hmm.  ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."""
You know him?	Heard of him.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.	Damn. All that reading paid off.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?	What do you think?
What do you think?	Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --	Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.	Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.	Don't care.
Don't care.	Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.	Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
Fine. How'd it go out here?	We're gonna have to talk...
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --	And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.	And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?	It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.	Bob's upset.
Bob's upset.	The posters?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!	Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
This has been a good year.	Jesse, we're outlaws.
Jesse, we're outlaws.	And we're good at it.
And we're good at it.	It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.	You've killed your fair share of men.
You've killed your fair share of men.	If I could go back to farming --
If I could go back to farming --	That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.	I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.	We're doing this for Ma.
We're doing this for Ma.	Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Maybe it started out that way. But now...	What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.	A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk.	Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.	Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?	No, I --
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.	Got any ideas, little brother?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.	Jim was old enough...
Jim was old enough...	He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?	Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.	You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.	Yeah.
Yeah.	A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.	See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.	Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...	Yeah, Jimmy?
Yeah, Jimmy?	...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.	I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.	Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.	That he was.
That he was.	They're making him a hero now.
They're making him a hero now.	Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.	But he killed a lot of men, too.
But he killed a lot of men, too.	Can't argue that.
Can't argue that.	So what was he?
So what was he?	I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Uncle Frank?	Yeah Jimmy?
Yeah Jimmy?	How much of that story is true?
How much of that story is true?	Everything but the boring parts.
Did you kill Yankees?	A fair number, Ma.
A fair number, Ma.	Say your prayers?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.	He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Easterners.	We're just fine, thank you, sir.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.	Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Ma! Please!	Boys?
Riders --	We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.	Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Doc Mimms will --	Shush.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?	You were little Jesse James when you left.
You were little Jesse James when you left.	But you got big!
But still died.	If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Jesse, are you awake?	Mmmm.
Jesse, is that your hand?	Nuh-huh ...
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.	You're sick of my company?
You're sick of my company?	No! I mean, of course not. No.
No! I mean, of course not. No.	Teasing you is completely unfair.
Teasing you is completely unfair.	What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.	I shouldn't tease a hero.
I shouldn't tease a hero.	What?
What?	Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.	I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.	So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?	Unfair. You are completely unfair.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.	You didn't want to farm?
You didn't want to farm?	I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.	A river pirate.

Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.	You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?	Not if I find the right girl.
Not if I find the right girl.	And what's this right girl like?
And what's this right girl like?	Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.	Where will you find such a girl?
Where will you find such a girl?	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
"Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."""	Sparkling rocks?
Sparkling rocks?	Little ones.
Little ones.	Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?

Yep.	Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?	I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
I am so sorry, Jesse.	Frank and me have to go away for a while.

That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.	Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?	I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.	Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.

We're moving you tomorrow.	But I like the presidential suite.
But I like the presidential suite.	Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.	So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?	That's the idea.
Did you order our houses burned down?	Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You almost ended my career before it began.	Pity.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?	Last February?

Was it worth it?	Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.

Ahh, you'll miss me.	No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.	Thanks.
Thanks.	I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.

Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.	I guess so.
I guess so.	I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?	Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?
You been with a girl ever?	Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?	I think so.
I think so.	You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?	I swear.
I swear.	Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.	You do that.
What about that Rock Island bastard?	It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
... too young for whisky...	This time we'll make an exception.
This time we'll make an exception.	Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...	You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Why, yeah.	I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.	Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.	Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Really?	I hope I'm not being too forward.
I hope I'm not being too forward.	Not at all.
Not at all.	I just though you were awful cute.
I just though you were awful cute.	Thank you, Miss -- ?
Thank you, Miss -- ?	Lyla Devereux.
Lyla Devereux.	Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?	Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.	Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?	That is so gentlemanly of you.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.	Really?
Really?	Don't talk about it much, though.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.	I'm doing you folks a favor --
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.	It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.	They had to be dealt with!
They had to be dealt with!	By burning down their homes?
How can that be?	They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
There's only four of them...	Move you fools!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.	And it is my pleasure to be here.
And it is my pleasure to be here.	Really!
Really!	NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!	I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.	Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.	Good.
Good.	Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.	Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	Just perfect.
Just perfect.	A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.	You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.	I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.	I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.	How much did they get from the safe?
How much did they get from the safe?	Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --	I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!	To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.	THEN WHO DID?!
THEN WHO DID?!	We did.
Your men knew the risks.	What is going on here, man?
With my money!	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
The final route for the railroad is complete.	I look forward to seeing it.
Parker.	Sir?
Sir?	What is that?
What is that?	What, sir?
That.	Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
This is him.	I remember you.
How did you know?	Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.	Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
You wouldn't have done that?	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.	I want them arrested and hanged!
I want them arrested and hanged!	Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.	This is no game.
This is no game.	I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
"""A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."""	It is a nice piece of writing.
It is a nice piece of writing.	"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"
"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"	Oh, that's the best part.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.	I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!	Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.	So you can't tell me anything?
So you can't tell me anything?	It's going to be a long winter.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.	All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.	I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.	And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.	I demand action.
I demand action.	No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?	Can't you tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?	It's going to be a long spring.
So he's won.	No.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.	In English, Pinkerton.
In English, Pinkerton.	There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.	Can you put men at all four?
Can you put men at all four?	No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.	What is that?
What is that?	Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
What the hell is that sound?	Vengeance.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?	What? Oh, I'm...busy.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.	Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?	Stop it. I'm...
Stop it. I'm...	On a lot of lithium?
On a lot of lithium?	Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.	You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?	Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?	Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.	Pumpkin?
Pumpkin?	Yes?
Yes?	Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

Uh huh.	Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.	I know. Stop it.
I know. Stop it.	Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.	Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.	Courtney? Dinner?
Courtney? Dinner?	I can't.
I can't.	I'm thinking Dorsia.
I'm thinking Dorsia.	Dorsia's nice.
Dorsia's nice.	Nice?
Nice?	You like it there, don't you?
You like it there, don't you?	The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	Okay. Yeah. What time?
Okay. Yeah. What time?	Eight?
Eight?	Pick me up?
Pick me up?	Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.	Is that Donald Trump's car?
Is that Donald Trump's car?	Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.	You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.	I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
J&B. Straight.	Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.	Are we here?
Are we here?	Yes.
Yes.	This is Dorsia?
This is Dorsia?	Yes, dear.
"Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."	Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Luis is a despicable twit.	Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
"No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?"" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me."	Is it a what?
Is it a what?	Pull out.
Pull out.	I'm ignoring you.
I'm ignoring you.	Pull out, goddamnit!
Pull out, goddamnit!	What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end. I think.	Turn the light on.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.	Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.	It's a plain end, see? So?
It's a plain end, see? So?	Take it off.
Take it off.	Why?
Why?	Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip 聳  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!	Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?	Oh God, just get it over with.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?	Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?	Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.	That's nice.
That's nice.	You and...Luis?
You and...Luis?	We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...	I never knew you smoked.
I never knew you smoked.	You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?	You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.	Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?	Yes, Courtney?
Patrick?	Yes?
Yes?	Nothing.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.
You just haven't been looking.	Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?	I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.	Do you take American Express?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?	Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...	Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.	I don't think so.
Nothing like last time, promise.	Alright.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?	Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.	Really?
Really?	My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.	Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
This is nicer than your other apartment.	It's not that nice.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.	Do...what.
Do...what.	Get married. Have a wedding.
Get married. Have a wedding.	Evelyn?
Evelyn?	Yes, darling?
Yes, darling?	Is your Evian spiked?
Is your Evian spiked?	We should do it.
We should do it.	No-I can't take the time off work.
No-I can't take the time off work.	Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.	I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.	Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.	Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.	Hi. Pat Bateman.
Why don t you just go for Price?	Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?	He's rich.
He's rich.	Everybody's rich.
Everybody's rich.	He's good-looking.
He's good-looking.	Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.	He has a great body
He has a great body	Everybody has a great body now.
Are you using minoxidil?	No. I'm not. Why should I ?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?	Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.	It's not.
I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Why? What's wrong?	My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk.	Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?	It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over	Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?	I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.	But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.	I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.	But what about the past? Our past?
But what about the past? Our past?	We never really shared one.
We never really shared one.	You're inhuman.
You're inhuman.	I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no.	I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.	Oh God, I can't believe this.
Oh God, I can't believe this.	I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
I'm just leaving.	But where?
But where?	I have to return some videotapes.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .	What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday	Good coloring.
Good coloring.	That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?	Nice.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?	I know her. I knew her.
Because he dated her.	How did you guess?
How did you guess?	Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?	Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?	No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Listen, what about dinner?	"Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about fucking dinner?"""
Are you my two o'clock?	No.
Can I help you?	I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	You saw the ad in the Times?
You saw the ad in the Times?	No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?	There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.	But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.	Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back.	I won't...don't worry.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.	Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?	Yes, naturally.
Yes, naturally.	Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
What exactly do you mean?	The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?	But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait.	Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.	What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?	Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...	Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.	Excuse me. I really must he going.
Excuse me. I really must he going.	No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer	But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.	It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?	It's just not.
It's just not.	Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.	No, you...didn't?
No, you...didn't?	Now, if you'll excuse me.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?	Lucky, I guess.
Lucky, I guess.	That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?	Uh huh.
Uh huh.	It looks so soft.
It looks so soft.	Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Patrick? Is that you?	No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.	This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?	Commes des Garcon.
Call me please, Patrick.	Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.	Patrick?
Patrick?	What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?	It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's Paul Owen.	That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-	I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.	Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?	Maybe it's just the light.
Maybe it's just the light.	Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...	What?
What?	It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.	I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
SHUT UP!	Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Calm down. Let's do it anyway	I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.	Like what?
Like what?	Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.	You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

Have you consulted a psychic?	No.

Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.	Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.	Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.	Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?	Not really.

No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.	Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.

And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.	Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?	I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?	I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.	But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.	Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?	I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.	Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?	I lost my job...

Cecelia is, well...you know	Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.	Another Martini, Paul?

No, man. I'm gonna bail.	Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?	They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.	But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.	I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.	...But?

To our new life.  ...What's wrong?	That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.	"He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, ""Did you really do this just today?"" Cause I was impressed. He said ""What're you implying?"""
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.

What!	Teddy was killed last night.
Teddy was killed last night.	What're you -- what?

That was -- different.	...Different?

No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --	Just shut up?
Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.	...What?

He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich茅 about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.	He wasn't acting?
He wasn't acting?	I don't think he knows how.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.	Right... What's that mean again?
Right... What's that mean again?	Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly.

I'm sure.	The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.

...Worse?	"Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  ""Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world."" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."

Gary, I --	You see what's hanging on the wall?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.	I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.	I do know. You focus on the big problem.

Did I say something?	No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
What've you got there?	Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?	Then and now.  But not right now.

How close are you?	What?
What?	He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.

When do I begin?	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.	Thank you, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
Yes?	Be careful.
Be careful.	Thanks.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.	Thank you, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
Yes?	Be careful.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.	Right away, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.	Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now.	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.	Thank you, Basil.
Thank you, Basil.	Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
Yes?	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.	Oh, yes. Thank you.
Oh, yes. Thank you.	There's one more thing, Austin.
There's one more thing, Austin.	Yes?
Yes?	Be careful.
Be careful.	Thank you.
Hello, Exposition.	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.	What's the other?
What's the other?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	What's the other thing you're scared of?
What's the other thing you're scared of?	Carnies.
Carnies.	What?
What?	Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
My God, Austin, what have you done?	That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.	I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?	Yes, Basil?
Yes, Basil?	Be careful.
Be careful.	Thanks.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!	Austin, I have something for you as well.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--	Yes Basil?
Yes Basil?	Be careful!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.	Hey, Mick!
Hey, Mick!	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?	Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, you can't always get what you want.	"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."
"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."	Good on ya, man.
Good on ya, man.	Groovy!
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?	That does not compute.
That does not compute.	Why not? It's a question.
Why not? It's a question.	Love is... love is... love is...
What's wrong with your hand?	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.

Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.	Man, you are one chilly square!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.	My mother's told me all about you.
My mother's told me all about you.	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...

Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	My wedding tackle.
My wedding tackle.	I'm sorry?
I'm sorry?	My meat and two veg.
My meat and two veg.	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?	A Chigro?
A Chigro?	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.	Sure.
Sure.	Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny?	What?
What?	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.	I'm sure.
I'm sure.	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.	Here, use mine.
Here, use mine.	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
I can't see a bloody thing.	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Why did you leave so soon?	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?	Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.	Why?
Why?	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
A limousine has just pulled up.	Let me see.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I never forget a pussy... cat.
Let's go get him!	He's too well-protected right now.
He's too well-protected right now.	We can't just sit here, Austin.
We can't just sit here, Austin.	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'

I don't get it.	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I hate having my picture taken.	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Fancy a nibble?	I couldn't have another bite.
Watch out, you're on my hair!	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.	Go! Just go!
I haven't had fun like that since college.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Why?
Why?	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.	No, this is me in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.	I am not.
I am not.	Oh, yes you are.
Oh, yes you are.	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I can't. You're drunk.	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Really, Austin!	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Austin, may I have a word with you?	Of course, luv.
Of course, luv.	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.	No, did you use a condom?
No, did you use a condom?	Only sailors use condoms, man.
Only sailors use condoms, man.	Not in the Nineties.
Not in the Nineties.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Hello, luv.	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?	Do you think she's prettier than I?
Do you think she's prettier than I?	Who?
Who?	You know who.
You know who.	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Does that make you horny?	Not now, Austin.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.	Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.
Indeed.	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.	Yes.
Yes.	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.	Shut up.
Shut up.	Fair enough.
What do we do now?	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.	I'll hurry back.
I'll hurry back.	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.	Oh, behave!
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.	Likewise.
Likewise.	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!	Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?	Don't worry!
Austin, I'm coming with you.	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.	I'll secure the perimeter.

Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?	Sure.
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.	Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Noooooooooooooo!	Where did you learn to shoot?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.	Is it one of ours?
Is it one of ours?	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.	What are you saying, son?
What are you saying, son?	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Oh my God, he's back.	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.

Shut up.	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?

Commander, I have to log it...	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;	Silence!
Ahhhhhhhhh!	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
We've got a lot of work to do.	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Ow! You shot me!	Right. Okay. Moving on.
Right. Okay. Moving on.	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?	Yes.
Yes.	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.	My son?
My son?	Yes.  Scott!
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Quite impressive.	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.	Dr. Evil?
Dr. Evil?	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.	Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
What is it now?	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?	Sea bass.
Sea bass.	Right.
Right.	They're mutated sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?	Please allow me to demonstrate.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Hi.	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?	Not me.
An evil vet?	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.	An evil petting zoo?
An evil petting zoo?	You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.

Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?	Yeah. What?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?	In due time.
In due time.	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?	I don't want to.
I don't want to.	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?	Blow me.
Blow me.	What did you say?
What did you say?	Show me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.	Scott, don't say that...
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.	"People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer."" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom."
Umm, that also has already happened.	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.	Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?	Great.
Great.	How's Austin?
How's Austin?	He's asleep.
He's asleep.	You didn't...
You didn't...	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I'm proud of you.	Why?
Why?	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.	What about his teeth?
What about his teeth?	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.	I just don't see it.
I just don't see it.	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.	Did you ever...
Did you ever...	Of course not. I was married to your father.
Of course not. I was married to your father.	Did you ever want to?
Did you ever want to?	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.	I love you, Vanessa.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?	Well, it's kind of weird.
Well, it's kind of weird.	We don't judge here.
We don't judge here.	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.	And how do you feel about that?
And how do you feel about that?	I don't wanna take over the family business.
What do you want to do, Scott?	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
We don't label people here, Scott.	No, he's really evil.
No, he's really evil.	Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.	"OK, Scott, no one really wants to ""kill"" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it."
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.	Really?

Would that I could say the Same.	Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --	You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
You	Have we met?
Have we met?	You mean you don't recall??
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
Promised? Who promised?	There, look!
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!	Sir August...?  What now?
May I help you, madam ...	Mr. John Steed, please.
Mr. John Steed, please.	I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm afraid that's impossible.	Impossible?
You are female?	As you see.
As you see.	Then you can't come in.
Then you can't come in.	I have an appointment.
I have an appointment.	No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.	Really -- what happened in 1922?
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?	Eh? In here!
Quite a collection.	If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.	This isn't a game.
This isn't a game.	Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
Rules are made to be broken.	People, too.
People, too.	Then who wins?
Then who wins?	You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...	Hmmm ...
Hmmm ...	Looks like rain, Steed...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
How curious ...	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.	Ropes?
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.	He tried to warn us ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?	Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.	After the cold war ...
I resign.	You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.	Watch me.

The Institute ... the funding ...	A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Who?	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?	To find out who killed my husband.
To find out who killed my husband.	The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.

'Our revels now are ended.'	Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...	I'm already married ...
I'm already married ...	Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.	Valentine, listen to me ...
Valentine, listen to me ...	Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.	Ring?

Then what's stopping you?	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.	Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

Really?  I fail to see the connection.	I had a feeling you would. Touche!

You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...	Do you really think so?
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?	Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
But why? What's the point?	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.

According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...	An eccentric recluse?

Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?	You should be dead.  How do you feel?

You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.	Frankly that's how I remember it.
Frankly that's how I remember it.	But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.	Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.	That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.	Did he say who?
Did he say who?	No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?	Did you say formal? I must dress.
I must say, you look more your old self --	You mean my other self ...
You mean my other self ...	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?	I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.	How on earth can you tell?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...	Very good, Steed ...
What on earth?	Any ideas?
Any ideas?	Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...	Is that written in his shoe?
Is that written in his shoe?	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...	She had this in her mouth. There, there...
For you, Mrs. Peel.	Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
But	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
Is there anything that isn't?	The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible.

The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?	Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...

But if someone miniaturized the process...	That's what we were working on.
That's what we were working on.	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.

... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?	Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?	According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Is that what you think?	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Do you always drive this fast?	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?	Barely.
Barely.	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
This must be the last straw.	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.	Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

Where am I?	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...	Was I?
Was I?	I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...	It was Peter -- I saw him ...
You followed me.	Orders.
Orders.	To kill me?
To kill me?	Nothing personal.
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.
No trouble.	Because you always obey orders ...
Because you always obey orders ...	Always.  Except ...
Yes ... ?	... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
And do you trust me?	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...	It wasn't me; you have my word.
Mmm ... what are you doing?	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?	Is that all?
But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.
Not for a moment.	You're playing games.
You're playing games.	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?	I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you played by the rules.	I thought you didn't.
I thought you didn't.	I'm playing to win.
I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.
Winning isn't everything.	Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?	As far as you trust me.
I told Mother I took care of you.	You lied.
You lied.	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?	No idea who. No idea why ...
No idea who. No idea why ...	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...

... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.	Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?	Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.	I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?	You'll find out.
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --	You didn't tell her?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.	Have we been invited?
What's that you're wearing?	It's called Black Leather.
It's called Black Leather.	Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
What is it?	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.	When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.	You first.
You first.	Shall we?
Trubshaw again? What now?	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.	'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?	Have a look at this.
I'll be back ...	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...	You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.	No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.	But --
But --	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.	If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Mrs. Peel?	What kept you?
What kept you?	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...

'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'	A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...	Still a bit chilly ...
Still a bit chilly ...	English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...	Have you any place in mind?
Have you any place in mind?	As a matter of fact I have ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.	Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?	Not quite.
Our chaperon.	Pity your mother came, too ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.	You're saying I have no choice.
Where's Mother?	Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
You don't believe him?	It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.	Decontamination -- ?
Decontamination -- ?	And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.	I see.
I see.	Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.	Peter's brother?  But --
Peter's brother?  But --	Half-brother to be precise.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...	I know all this.
I know all this.	Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?	Surveillance? By whom?
Surveillance? By whom?	Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.	Who's now vanished.
Who's now vanished.	Makes two of us.
Makes two of us.	Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I was getting to it.	Getting to what?
Getting to what?	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --	I fail to see --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...	Well, I can't possibly go like this.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...	... and now?
Privately owned by ...	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...	I shall need a small plane.
I shall need a small plane.	You're not venturing alone, surely.
You're not venturing alone, surely.	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...	Global warming?
Global warming?	Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.	So you say ...
Oh, hello ...	We want Mrs. Peel.
We want Mrs. Peel.	Dead, I'm afraid.
Steed	How did you guess?
How did you guess?	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...	It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'	Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Weather's turning nasty.	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.	Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.	Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Think she really killed those agents?	She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.	Amnesia?
Amnesia?	Possibly. Split personality ...
Possibly. Split personality ...	Insane ... ?
Insane ... ?	Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.	Why?
Why?	She may try to kill you.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.	How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.	Anyone particular in mind?
Anyone particular in mind?	You.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...	Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.	Impossible.
This man -- did you see him?	No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?	Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --	Guilty until proven innocent?
Guilty until proven innocent?	Mother and Father know best.
I was hoping you could tell me.	You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.	I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.	Where?
Where?	In your operation.
In your operation.	I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Are you alright, young man?	I think so, thank you so much ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.	I feel sure of it.
I feel sure of it.	I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?	She was ...
You with Mother or Father?	Both, actually.
Both, actually.	Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.	You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...

You're better than I expected.	I was at Harrow ...
I was at Harrow ...	But did they teach you this?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.	You wish.

Look at that guy. What a hunk.	Check out the other guy's buns.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.	Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?	O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.	He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.	No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.	You're kidding.
You're kidding.	Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
That's what we're going to find out...	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

We're going for a little liquid refreshment.	Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
I've decided not to run for President.	Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.	Hey, man, congratulations!
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?	Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.	I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.	What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
All right!	When do the girls get to the party?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
And...	Bond... James Bond.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?	I want Debbie.
I want Debbie.	Cole...

You dump her and I'll give you cash.	What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?	Five thousand dollars.
Five thousand dollars.	No.
Seventy-five hundred.	Not interested.
Not interested.	Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...	I'm marrying Debbie.

Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.	He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.	Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.

Great car.	The best.

I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.	The car for Debbie?
The car for Debbie?	I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.	Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.

Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.	Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?

Cole, what the hell are you doing?	She's mine!
"He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: ""24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!"" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters."	Fan out and look for them.
Hello?	Mr. Thomerson.
Mr. Thomerson.	Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?	Yes I did.
Yes I did.	Fine. How's everything going?
Fine. How's everything going?	Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Hi, everybody. Am I late?	Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?	Sure have...
Nice shot.	Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.	I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.	Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir, I am.	Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.	I've tried to change her mind.
I've tried to change her mind.	It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.	But how can I do that?
But how can I do that?	If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.	Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.	Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.	Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?	The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...	Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?	1002.
1002.	All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.	Yes, sir.

Cole, we've got to talk.	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?	No, Cole, I...
No, Cole, I...	It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.	Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...	You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...	Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?	I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.

God, you're a slob.	But a fabulous cook.
But a fabulous cook.	What are we having?
What are we having?	It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.	I think your dinner's burning.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.	Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.	You're going to have a bachelor party?
You're going to have a bachelor party?	Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?	It looks awful.
It looks awful.	Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.	Are you going to have women at your party?
Are you going to have women at your party?	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.	Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?	Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Huh? Wha...	I can't sleep.
I can't sleep.	Oh... I got something for that.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.	What's the matter?
What's the matter?	I don't know... I just feel scared.
I don't know... I just feel scared.	About what?
About what?	The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...	I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.	Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?	C'mere.
That feels so great.	Good...
Good...	Um... that's very relaxing.
Um... that's very relaxing.	Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.	You better not have too much joy.
You better not have too much joy.	Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	Gonna get married...
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
Can't I just go with you guys?	Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.	Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...	You're really pissing me off.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.	Your mother's not dead.
Your mother's not dead.	Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.	I love you.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.	How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.	Why don't you get undressed.
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
C'mon, I knew it was you.	Rick, you're lying!
Let go of me!	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.	The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.	I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.	And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.	I am committed. I love you.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?	Yes...
Yes...	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	Let's get naked.
Let's get naked.	You're on.
Are you okay?	Yeah.
Yeah.	This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?	You're so romantic...
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.	Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.	Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?	Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, Rick promised...	Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Are you sure this is a good idea?	Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.	That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.	Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Let's go.	Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!	Ilene, are you crazy?
Ilene, are you crazy?	I know what I'm doing... Go!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.	Great, Mom.
Why is Cole here?	You know your father enjoys his company.
A strange wang right in my palm.	Ilene, we don't really know that.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.	Quiet, Mother.
I hope Ilene's all right.	I hope those guys are all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.	My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?	A real turd.
A real turd.	Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Great bathing suit.	I think I screwed that one once.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.	Any time, Al.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.	Let's see your bread.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.	They'll be up there in a half hour.
They'll be up there in a half hour.	Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?	What are you talking about, asshole?
What are you talking about, asshole?	Your whores never showed up.
Your whores never showed up.	They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.	Screw you!
That's it, prick lips.	What are you...
What are you...	I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?	Why?
Why?	Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.	Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.	Gary, you're quite an animal.
Gary, you're quite an animal.	Screw you...
Let's go.	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?	All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?	Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.	Let's have a toast.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.	What's going on?
It's true.	This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.	Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.	I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.	Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.	Screw that.
Hookers beat you up?	Yes.
Yes.	I didn't know you were into that.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.	This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
What can I be doing for you?	You're a pimp?
You're a pimp?	I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.	I want women.
I want women.	That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.	I'll take some.
I'll take some.	Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.	I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.	You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.	Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.	Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.	Milt?
So, Larry, how have you been?	Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Larry, you and your wife got problems?	I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Is that all the coke in the place?	That's it.
That's it.	Good.
You want to share it?	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.	Right.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.	Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.	She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?	What do you mean, it changes?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.	I just want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.	"All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after ""Falcon Crest."""
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.	No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I guess so.	Really?
Really?	Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
What the hell are you doing?	I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.	You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?	I couldn't find any razor blades.
I couldn't find any razor blades.	Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.	Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.	No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.	It's Bullwinkle.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...	It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Are any of those right?	This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?	Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
It's on the tenth floor.	What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.	I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
You're all under arrest. Open up!	Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Oops!	All right, who serves?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.	Can't I just maim it a little?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.	Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.	I'd love that.
I'd love that.	Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.	Mr. Thomerson, I...
Mr. Thomerson, I...	Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...	Feel free.
Feel free.	First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
Rick!	Oh, no!
The end.	No sob story is going to change my mind.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...	Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?	In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.	You can tell a man by his friends.
Ed... you're kinky!	The phone made me do it!
The phone made me do it!	You've been having strange sex...!
You've been having strange sex...!	No, Brett, I...
No, Brett, I...	It's all right...  So have I.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?	Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.	Mrs.?
Mrs.?	I'm separated.
I'm separated.	Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?	Of course.
Where'd she go?	She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Where the hell is he?	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
What's the matter?	Nothing... Let's get crazy!
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."	Olivier's in that, right?
Olivier's in that, right?	Then it's on to the real thing.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.	This isn't right.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?	Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.	I'm not really hungry.
I'm not really hungry.	C'mon. I insist.
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
My gift to you.	Under the table!
Under the table!	The best table in the house.
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?	I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Rick, I'm concerned.	About what?
About what?	This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.	Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.	I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.	Oooooo.
Oooooo.	Right in there, pal.
Right in there, pal.	If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.	That's the old Rick!
How'd it go?	Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.	I'm proud of you, lad.
Who was that?	I don't know.
I don't know.	What's this?
What's this?	Got me.
How 'bout this?	Still drawing a blank.
He look familiar?	Very.
Very.	C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.
Hey, you guys...	Who's your friend?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.	And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What are you going to do about it?	What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.	I'll stop him... You stall him.
Reach out and snort someone.	I'm saved. Let's party!
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.	Who?
Who?	Debbie.
Debbie.	My Debbie?
My Debbie?	What's with her costume?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.	You got it.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.	Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.	True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?	You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.	Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.	Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.	Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.	Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?	Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.	Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.	Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.	There can be no excuse for tardiness.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.	You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.	Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.	Right... Think it over.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?	I don't know.
I don't know.	What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.	Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.	I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?	Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Oh these moments do try me...	Be gentle.
Wash it to the windows?	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.	Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?	No.  I need a drink.
You know Knowlton pretty well?	Yeah...
Yeah...	Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Biggest in two battalions.	We're gonna be okay, man...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.	It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.	-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...	-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.	They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- Knock it off!	-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?	There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!	Stevie... I...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.	My Lt. might have something to say about that.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.	Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.	John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Is he...	He's alive.
Did you do it for Tim?	That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
Just come down, John. Just --	-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- He killed people --	-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --	-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --	-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
Who asked you?	If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?	I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.	So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.	Not likely.
Not likely.	Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along... want a beer?
Been ripping off fire stations?	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.	What, you've never seen one before?
What, you've never seen one before?	In the Field Museum once.
In the Field Museum once.	It works.
It works.	It worked when you were in sixth grade.
People actually used to pay you for this?	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.	Sheep don't count.
Sheep don't count.	Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah? What about Laura --	That was never proved.
Why'd you come here, Brian?	"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"
"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"	What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.	Hey! You don't know me --
Hey! You don't know me --	I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?	Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.	Thanks for the speakers.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...	Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.	I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.	I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Ya love it, probie?	I'm in heaven, Lt.
I'm in heaven, Lt.	Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.	-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- C'mon, Stephen.	-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Goddamn it Stephen!	-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I told you to stay next to me!	-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!	What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...	-- Never mind.
Thanks.	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.	Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.	C'mon, let's crawl home.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...	This?
This?	Yeah... too bright...
Roll the hose.	What, are you kidding? By myself?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.	You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?	No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.	Roll the hose.
Ready?	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...	Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You okay?	I waited... I would have fucking waited...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...	That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.	Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?	You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.	Thanks for the insight.
Thanks for the insight.	Brian, look --
Brian, look --	Just leave me alone, okay?
...Not now, Brian.	Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?	I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I had that fire. He didn't listen!	He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.	Fuck you.
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Just... Just wanted to say hello...	So hello.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.	You're selling dad's boat?
You're selling dad's boat?	Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...	I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.	Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.	Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --	-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
It's okay, Stephen, I --	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I saw it.	Saw what?
Saw what?	When dad died, I saw another fire...
When dad died, I saw another fire...	Everybody did.
Everybody did.	I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.	...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?	I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.	Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --	-- What are you doing here?
-- What are you doing here?	I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!	I know.
I know.	How do you know?
How do you know?	I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.	-- What were they doing there?
-- What were they doing there?	They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?
What are we going to do about this?	I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?	Shut up!
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?	"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""
"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""	Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Brian.	Jennifer.
Jennifer.	You're back.
You're back.	You look great.
You look great.	Thanks for calling.
Thanks for calling.	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.	Huh.
Huh.	So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.	Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.	Yeah? What have you been up to?
Yeah? What have you been up to?	I work for city hall.
I work for city hall.	Really? No kidding.
Really? No kidding.	What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.	I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
With grenadine, right?	When I was twenty.
When I was twenty.	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?	Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?	Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.	Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.	So now you suddenly care about my future?
So now you suddenly care about my future?	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.	...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.	Yeah...
Arson.	Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Hey.	How's it going?
How's it going?	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.	Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
I could use a date.	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hi.	Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?	If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...	Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?	You think that's really any of your business?
You think that's really any of your business?	Well, you did invite me here.
Well, you did invite me here.	Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Okay.	Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.	But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
Got anything to drink in there?	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?	Homey.
Homey.	See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?	Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.	When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.	Then why did you quit?
Then why did you quit?	I wanted to be a good one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.	Uh huh.
Brian. What's wrong?	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.	I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --	-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --	Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.	I was doing my job.
I was doing my job.	"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"	Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --	Leave Stephen out of this --
Leave Stephen out of this --	Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --	-- I work for the city.
-- I work for the city.	You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --	Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.	I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.	You could check. It'd be in his files.
You could check. It'd be in his files.	Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you know what you're asking me to do?	Yes.
Yes.	Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
What is --	Just take it.
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.
That's a dumb thing to say.	You're right.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.	I quit two days ago, Brian.
I quit two days ago, Brian.	What'll you do?
What'll you do?	I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have the slightest idea...	I'll see ya around, huh?
I'll see ya around, huh?	It's a small town.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?	Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...	So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
Who's doing this?	Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?	Then who --
Then who --	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.	I don't have a story.
I don't have a story.	Sure you do.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?	What?
What?	You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --	I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...	Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.	The outlets.
The outlets.	That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.	Trychticholorate.
Trychticholorate.	Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Who the fuck is doing this?	After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Oh Jesus Christ...	Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.	You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?	I want another shot, Sir.
I want another shot, Sir.	Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?	If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.	I need another one, sir.
I need another one, sir.	Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.	No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.	Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.	See you Monday. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.	Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Are you still here?	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.	Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.	I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.	Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Where are you going?	Pest control.
-- Shhh.	What are you listening to?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.	Glass?
Glass?	Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...	-- Another backdraft.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.	No it couldn't.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...	I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
Read.	"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""

Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.	Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.	And the putty around the door?
And the putty around the door?	Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!	What?
What?	I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.

But he killed these guys.	But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.	What reason?
What reason?	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.	Are you going public with this?
Are you going public with this?	No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
What the hell are you doing here?	I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?	Fire.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.	Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.	Nice bunch of guys.
Nice bunch of guys.	Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.	Yeah? Airtight?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.	Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

Then who wrote the report?	It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...	How ya feeling?
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Did I say thanks?
Did I say thanks?	No.
No.	Just wondering.
Just wondering.	I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
So what do you want me to do?	I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Your brother was a good man.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.

Brian?	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.	You look like... Brian.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?	Four months.
Four months.	Four months?
Four months?	I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.	Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?	Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. Big fan.	And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.	Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.	No need to be modest, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.	No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.	-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.	Every little boy's fantasy.
Every little boy's fantasy.	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.	I have a job.
I have a job.	This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.

Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Mr. McCaffrey...	Nice boat.
Nice boat.	It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
Aren't you even curious?	Engine 115, right?
Engine 115, right?	How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.	Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.	You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?	Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.	Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.	Backdraft.
Do you have to do that?	Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
"Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? ""You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it""."	Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
What?	"""Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."""
So, you surviving without me?	There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.	It's in my blood, Willy.

Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?	Firehouse.
Firehouse.	Cute.
Dad!	You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.	Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.	I'm busy.

You can't talk about my brother like that...	Here we go...
Stephen, what are you doing here?	Fixing my roof.
Fixing my roof.	It's not your roof anymore.

Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.	Yeah? When was the last time?
Yeah? When was the last time?	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...

I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...	What's wrong?
What's wrong?	I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.	Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Look, I'm sorry I --	-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.	Putty? On both doors?
Putty? On both doors?	There's something else kinda interesting...
Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?	Investigator...
I'm a little busy right now --	This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!	Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!	It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --	Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.	They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.

It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.	Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.	I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?	What's to believe?
What's to believe?	That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
People.	You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?	Yeah.
Yeah.	OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!	Why?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.	Who?
Who?	Those fucking Mob assholes.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Then c'mere. I got something for you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?	Nah...
Nah...	Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...	Who?
Who?	A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...	You mean you could use it.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!	"""The Strawberries""?"
"""The Strawberries""?"	The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?	I'm a Catholic.
You took the chalice.	Yes.
Yes.	You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.	Yes.
Are you all right, honey?	I was gonna bring it back myself.
So what are you doing here?	He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.	That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.	What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?	The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.

How are you doing, man?	Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?	Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.	I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.

I forgive you.	Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you.	Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --

Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.	Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.	All right. What are you gonna do?
All right. What are you gonna do?	I want 15 on the Mets.

Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!	There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!	That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Do you have the money?	What money?
What money?	Don't bullshit me.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.	This psycho can.
This psycho can.	Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.	You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!	Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --	Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --	He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?	I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
How's the case going?	What case?
What case?	The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.	That 50 G could help you --
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --	You've really got a problem.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?	Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.	Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?	It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.	I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?	I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.	As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --	Yes, Sister?
Yes, Sister?	Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.	You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.	How 'bout...

Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?

How much?	First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
What kind of show is this gonna be?	Different.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?	You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Nice to meet you.	And this is Manray.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.	We might need some mo' money behind this.
We might need some mo' money behind this.	That can be done.

I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.	No costume.  No blackface.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?	Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.	No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?	Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?	But the line has to be drawn.
But the line has to be drawn.	Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.	Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?	Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.	I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry I'm late.	Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?	I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Four minutes ago.	So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?	I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?	C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.	I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.	Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
"I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."	I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.	NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.	I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.	I'm telling you it's not.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...	...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.	I've never been given a fair shot.
I've never been given a fair shot.	You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.	"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"

I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"	"That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.	You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.	It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.	I'm wid it.
I'm wid it.	I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.	Go on.  Good so far.
Go on.  Good so far.	I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Word!!!	So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.	The name of the show?
The name of the show?	It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I'm feelin' dis'!	It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.	Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?	I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.	Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle.	Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.	I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.	What are there character traits?
What are there character traits?	Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.	Exactly!
Exactly!	Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?	Yep, you guessed it.
Yep, you guessed it.	"This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
"Protest finally forced ""Amos and Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on."	Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Negroes would be in an uproar.	So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.	Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.	Who are the other characters?
Who are the other characters?	Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?	"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""	Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.	I don't know about that plantation angle.
I don't know about that plantation angle.	What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!	We think so.
We think so.	Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
"I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing ""Amos and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain."	To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.	I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.	You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?	I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.	Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?	Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?	"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."
"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."	That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?	No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!	Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.	Dunwitty, don't leave.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!	Calm down, please.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.	Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.	I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?	They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.	This has to be a big mistake.

Good woman.  I trained her right.	Daddy, she's younger than me.
Daddy, she's younger than me.	My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Purely for medicinal purposes.	I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.	How did you end up here?
How did you end up here?	How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
That's what I'm askin'.	Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.	Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.	Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?	"All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the ""life's too short"" category."
Enough about me, what's happening with you?	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?	Nuthin' I can't handle.
Nuthin' I can't handle.	The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.

Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.	I didn't mean that, in life.
I didn't mean that, in life.	In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Let's get him over to the bed.	Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
I love you too, Daddy.	Always keep 'em laughing.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.	Is that so?
How long has my father been like this?	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.	So he drank himself into a stuper?

The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.	So what's up with you?
So what's up with you?	I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.	Your father is proud of you.
He never showed it.	He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
How was it?	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?	Nobody told me anything.
Nobody told me anything.	What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?	It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!	Manray!
How did you know?	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.	How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.	The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.	Do you know how you will use him?
Do you know how you will use him?	Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You lost me.	Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.	What point is that?
What point is that?	The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.	Sounds risky to me.
Sounds risky to me.	You getting cold feet?
You getting cold feet?	I'm in till the end.
I'm in till the end.	Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.	Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hello.	This is Cheeba.
You okay?	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What is your problem?	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?	It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.	Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.	What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.	Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.	Hello.
Hello.	I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?
Which one is your brother?	The big one.
You've said that already.	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.	We both lied to him.
We both lied to him.	What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?	Just don't lie to me.
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.	C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.	Everybody shut up.
So you have your small victory, now what?	A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
What is this?	A gift.
A gift.	For what?
For what?	No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.	This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.	Thanks.
Thanks.	I thought it was appropiate.
I thought it was appropiate.	Is that good or bad?
Is that good or bad?	It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.	How so?
How so?	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.	How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?	You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.	He's just playing big brother.
He's just playing big brother.	Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?	Please don't go there.
Please don't go there.	Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.	Do you have to be so damn forthright?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	Light?
Light?	That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.	You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.	Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.	DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.	And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't make me have to use this.	I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.	Give me the gun.
Yes, your name?	He, I'm Mona.
He, I'm Mona.	Hi, Mona.
Hi, Mona.	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.

This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.	David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.	"I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.	Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.	I didn't mean it to sound like that.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.	The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Can I kiss you too?	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.	You feel good, not nervous?
You feel good, not nervous?	I feel fine.
I feel fine.	Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?	Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
So they can be on TV.	You sound like the media.
You sound like the media.	This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.	Same thing Giuliani said.
Same thing Giuliani said.	Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
No joke.  Serious.	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.	In time.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?	No.
No.	You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?	Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?	Yeah.
Yeah.	And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.	What you did is dead wrong.
What you did is dead wrong.	Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.	Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.	Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.	I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.	Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.	My name is Manray, goddamnit.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.	Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.	It looks delicious.
It looks delicious.	You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.	I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
How's the food?	Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.	That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.	Mommy, please don't call me that.
Mommy, please don't call me that.	Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.	I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?	I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?	To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?	Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.	Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.	I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, your father called.	I'll be right over.
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?
He said that?	Yes he did.
Yes he did.	Where is he?
Where is he?	He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.	I can't go all the way down south.
Richmond is not all the way down south.	I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.	Regardless, he still is your father.
Regardless, he still is your father.	It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.	Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.	C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.	Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?	Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?	No.
No.	Not at all?
Not at all?	You know how your Daddy is.
You know how your Daddy is.	If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.	I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?	Soon.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?	I just turned twenty.
Where are you from?	Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.	Finland.
Finland.	You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?	Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?	What's a Negro.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.	Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!	Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?	Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.	Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
How did you get this gig?	My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?	This is a TV show, not a music video.
This is a TV show, not a music video.	Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?	This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.	Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.	First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
"The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em."	We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Let Myrna finish.	Thank you.  And always smile.
Yes you!	This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I never had a really real pair before.	You've never had any formal training, either?
You've never had any formal training, either?	Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.

No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.	I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.

You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.	Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.

Tavis, thank you for having me.	Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.

Money and nothing else?	Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.

Is it inevitable that the game plays you?	No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.

I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.

I fell out of my bed last night.	You slept too near where you got in?

How be dat?	I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.	Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.	Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
I feel a song a comin' on.	A song a comin' I feel.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
A lot?	Enough.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.	I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.	We can look out for ourselves.
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.	Y'know what?

Oh, you gonna make me say it.	Say what, Manray?

We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.	Aw, c'mon.
Aw, c'mon.	That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
"So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."	Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?	Don't try to change to the subject.

Why don't you answer?	I know I won't be your puppet.
I know I won't be your puppet.	You can go now.
You can go now.	I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good day to you, young sir.	Good morning.
Good morning.	Where are you bound for?
Where are you bound for?	That is none of your business.
That is none of your business.	Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --	If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Both of us ride home with Best here.	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.	You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?	Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.	It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.

Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.	I never was more in earnest.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.	What is your uncle's name?
What is your uncle's name?	O'Grady.
O'Grady.	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?	This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.	Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.	The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.	The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Where's the beauty you promised me?	It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.	I have acted as I think fit.
I have acted as I think fit.	Sir, I'm a British officer.
Sir, I'm a British officer.	It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.	How do you do, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.	Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.	What is the service, sir?
What is the service, sir?	There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?	Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.	I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?	I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Has he sent the challenge yet?	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.	And his baggage?
And his baggage?	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!	Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.	And so I am.
And so I am.	And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?	Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?

No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.

I am not afraid of him.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.	In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Have you taken my message to him?	The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.	My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?	Your cousins go out with him.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.	It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.	I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.	I'll match any man with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.	But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.	It must have been some other gate.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.	A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.

I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.	Is Miss Dugan well?
Is Miss Dugan well?	There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?	She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!	No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

The coward!	He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.	I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!	You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!	Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.	I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.

Where is my rascal, Lazlo?	I will let down the steps for your honor.
Good gracious!  What is this?	You are going to drive to the frontier.
You are going to drive to the frontier.	It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.	I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.

Your honor must lower his voice.	All Europe shall hear of this!

I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.	Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.	For whom else have you worked?
For whom else have you worked?	No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

Who else can give me information about you?	Only the agency of servants.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.	I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?	I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.	We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.	Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.	I believe they will deport you.

I have faced that problem before.	But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?	Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.

Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?	Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?	Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.	To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.

I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.	Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?	Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.	Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.

No.	Have you had one?
Have you had one?	Never.
Never.	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

Not even that.	How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?

That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.	What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?	Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.	Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.	"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."

But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.	That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.	It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.

I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.	How so?
How so?	By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
You want my heart?	It is my only object.
It is my only object.	To make me wretched in two weeks.
To make me wretched in two weeks.	To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.

Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.	But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?	With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?	Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.	You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?	Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?	I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Will we always leave it at this?	Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.	I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.	Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.

Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.	My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.	Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.

"We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"""
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:	Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.	Old fool!
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.	Agreed.
Agreed.	Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.
Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.	Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?	I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?	But you refused me, Dorothy.
But you refused me, Dorothy.	Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.	If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.	But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.	What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?	As much as possible.
As much as possible.	As much as possible?
As much as possible?	Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.	All the same, you must name an amount.
All the same, you must name an amount.	It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.	All right, five hundred guineas.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.	Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?	By name only.
By name only.	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?	Yes!
Yes!	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Does this assignment interest you?	Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Was he cheated?	In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.	Hmm-mmmm.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.	The Prince left him only that choice.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.	When is he to go?
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?	"Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him ""good luck."""
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?	Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.	But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?	That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.	You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.	Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.

I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.	There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?	May I be quite frank with you?
May I be quite frank with you?	Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.

I see.	When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Did you buy the horse, papa?	Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.	But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, papa.	Good night, my little darling.
Good night, my little darling.	Papa?
Papa?	Yes?
Yes?	One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?	What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.	Yes, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.	Is he all right, papa?
Is he all right, papa?	Yes, he's fine.
Yes, he's fine.	Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.	Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.	The milkmaid's daughter?
The milkmaid's daughter?	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.	Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?	He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?	I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?	Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.	Sir, let those laugh that win.
Sir, let those laugh that win.	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Charming Schuvaloff.	Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.	Dark Valdez.
Dark Valdez.	Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.	And he doesn't care about me?
And he doesn't care about me?	He is only curious to know who you are.
He is only curious to know who you are.	If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.	He loves me, as I love you.
He loves me, as I love you.	Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?	He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.	Tender Hegenheim.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.	You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
It's ten thirty in the morning.	Yeah, if you've slept.
Yeah, if you've slept.	You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.	"Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
Hurricane kept you up, too?	Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Bill Styles...	Who?
Who?	Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry...
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?	I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.	Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
What do we do?	Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
I don't want to go --	Fine.
Did -- did you --	It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
What about Pike?	Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
He is the only one unaccounted for.	Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
You framed-him...	None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --	Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --	We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We got -- I don't know, we got separated	Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --	I don't know!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.	HEY!
West was one thing, but this --	Shut up, Mueller.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?	We don't know. West is dead.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --	What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this...
Yeah, right...	Shut up.  West's dead.
You too?	We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Why not?	I asked for a policeman.
I asked for a policeman.	You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?	It's... too slow.
It's... too slow.	Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.	I just don't like it.
I just don't like it.	What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army.	C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.	You did Basic here?
You did Basic here?	Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
There's no need...	They're dead, aren't they?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?	Okay.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
I'm not telling you what happened.	Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Some.	Tell me about them.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?	Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
You smoke, Ray?	This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.	No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!	That son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.	That'd be my reaction too --
That'd be my reaction too --	He's lying.
He's lying.	Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --	I'm serious --
"Fuck ""you're serious"", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it."	Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --	I didn't shoot West --
I didn't shoot West --	Yeah, we know, Pike did.
I apologize --	You saw West's body.
You saw West's body.	Of course --
And he'd been shot.	Yeah --
You shot Childs and Nunez.	They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.	You saved Kendall's life --
You saved Kendall's life --	But not Pike's.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --	Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
We don't need the tapes --	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?	We've found all of them.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --	Jesus!
He -- He made me do it --	Do what?
Do what?	Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.	And the bodies?
And the bodies?	You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...	"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."	He's telling the truth up to a point...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?	No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.	Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.	There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?	Epilepsy.
Epilepsy.	Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He said he worked there --	No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?	What business?
What business?	Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Where?	The creek bed --
What about the phosphorous grenade?	One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Back up.	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?	Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?	Would you have believed me?
Where's the cabin?	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.	Can't do that now, though, can you?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.	We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --	Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...	How do you know that?
How do you know that?	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Cadet, what's your name!	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!	You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?	Sir, yes, sir!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?	Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!	The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
What the fuck is going on?	Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody...	Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --	I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.	Why?
Why?	We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Jesus, what happened?	West... he's dead.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.	So did we. Why didn't you come?
So you killed him?	I...
Whose blood is that, Jay?	West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's?	I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Where have you been, Jay?	Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
We just want to check your pack --	Why?
You know it's not like that --	Do I?
Right?	Yeah...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.	You hated West more than any of us.
You hated West more than any of us.	Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --	You're the only one missing a grenade.
You're the only one missing a grenade.	Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.	If not you, then who?
If not you, then who?	Mueller.
Mueller.	Oh, come on --
Oh, come on --	We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --	That's exactly what he says about you.
That's exactly what he says about you.	Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --	Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --	Bullshit.
Bullshit.	Look in my pack.
Look in my pack.	Why?
Why?	Just look. Little pocket.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.	You're lying --
You're lying --	Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Why... why didn't you tell me?	Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?	Full clip to the body --
Full clip to the body --	From up close or far away?
From up close or far away?	His chest was hamburger --
His chest was hamburger --	That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...	They?
They?	Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
What don't you know?	This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --	No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --	We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --	Put it down!
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?	Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --	Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.	But not the only victim, right?
But not the only victim, right?	My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.	Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.	He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?	"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."
"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."	The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
"Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called ""motive"" and you just gave yourself one."	You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.	"What happened to ""degrees""?"
"What happened to ""degrees""?"	I didn't kill him --
I didn't kill him --	Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.	But you didn't.
But you didn't.	No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it.	Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you?	I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.	Mr. Hardy?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --	Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --	How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.	Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.	My heart weeps.
Is it the truth?	There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --	So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --	Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.	No. I said Dunbar.
No. I said Dunbar.	"Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said ""Dunbar was gone,"" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."
"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""	Well?
Well?	Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Dunbar will testify that you were.	Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Something funny, Levi?	I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --	I didn't do anything --
Why?	Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?	I didn't --
I didn't --	But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!	I don't know --
I don't know --	Where are they!
Where are they!	Maybe --
Maybe --	MAYBE WHAT --
MAYBE WHAT --	Maybe he...
How are you?	Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --	What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad?	Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --	Tell me what I can do.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.	And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
"The official term for it is ""Clusterfuck"". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."	It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.	Well, he's a good soldier.
"The exercise was one of his Section Eight ""private sessions"". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."	And the problem is you only got three.
And the problem is you only got three.	No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.	I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?	Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?	The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.	And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --	I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --	He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.	Who killed Pike?
Who killed Pike?	Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.	There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.	Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.	Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --	Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.	From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.	Nevertheless --
Nevertheless --	Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.	Not for me.
You mean not enough to save you.	JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Tom, where are you going --	Home, I'm done.
Home, I'm done.	What about the confession?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --	What the hell are you talking about --
What the hell are you talking about --	I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
What I said before --	Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Does Osborne agree?
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.	That's horseshit and you know it.
That's horseshit and you know it.	Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You think you could explain all this to me?	I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
They're taking your command, aren't they?	The Senator...
I'm sorry, Bill.	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.	You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.	You're drunk --
You're drunk --	I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Stay where you are.	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --	West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.	That's preposterous --
That's preposterous --	Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

I wanted to see if he was okay --	You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.	I'm not even going to dignify that --
I'm not even going to dignify that --	No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --	You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.

No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.	You're crazy --
You're crazy --	You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.	For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --	Get your hands away from the desk!
Hostile and uncooperative.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
You knew Sergeant West?	He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.	Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.	And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --	You and the Colonel go back.
You and the Colonel go back.	He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.	You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.	It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --	Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.	Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.	Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --	Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --	Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.	Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --	Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.	He's in interrogation?
He's in interrogation?	Yes.
Yes.	Move him.
Move him.	Why?
Why?	Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	Is Dunbar cute?
Is Dunbar cute?	That is the most unprofessional --
That is the most unprofessional --	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.	Good cop/bad cop?
Good cop/bad cop?	Something like that.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.	Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --	"See, Ray, this is what we call ""good cop, bad cop"". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established."
Baseball?	I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --	You made me look like an idiot --
You made me look like an idiot --	Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?	You're right. We should sit in silence.
You're right. We should sit in silence.	We're in the middle of a murder case --
We're in the middle of a murder case --	Best time for banal chit-chat.
What is that?	Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.	You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.	Something like that. You?
Something like that. You?	I lost a bet.
You're kidding.	Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?	The very same.
The very same.	You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?	I plan to grow on you.
I plan to grow on you.	You're off to a late start.
You're off to a late start.	So noted.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.	Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?	He's telling the truth, up to a point.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.	What point?
Something wrong?	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.	Not the happiest of memories?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.	Got it.
That was kid gloves?	Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --	I lied. Wait for it...
"""Too neat."" How long have you been an investigator?"	I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't think that has anything to do with --	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.	Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.	Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?	I don't know.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --	You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --	Watch me.
Watch me.	You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.	You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --	Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --	"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"
"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"	But you will.
Why do you care?	Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
I didn't shoot West...	What?
What?	Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	What happened next?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.	And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.	Dunbar.
Dunbar.	Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.	They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.	And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.	So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --	Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --	Buttfucks the cabin?
Buttfucks the cabin?	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.	So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?	That bugs you too?
That bugs you too?	Little bit.
Little bit.	Let's go talk to Bill...
We're fucked, I know --	They got their stories straight.
They got their stories straight.	What?
What?	"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."
"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?	Good idea.
That's a fantastic idea --	See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
I pushed him too hard.	You couldn't have known --
You couldn't have known --	Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.	You wanted to get the truth.
You wanted to get the truth.	No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.	You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
Yeah.	So did I.
So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.	Think it'll work?
Think it'll work?	Nah.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.	It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.	For what?
For what?	That's gonna stay my secret.
We were close to something with Kendall.	Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?	No.
No.	Good, just making sure.
Four --	Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Right back where we started.
Hardy, what are you doing --	Isn't this how your story goes?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --	Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No bodies, no West...	No death certificates. No crime.
We need to talk --	Seven.
What?	"Seven guys. What was it you said? You were ""just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said""."
This isn't the time --	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.	What if I don't want it?
What if I don't want it?	Tough.
That's not true.	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.	You're a good man, Hardy.
You're a good man, Hardy.	Really.
Really.	Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
West?	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Do I have a choice in this?	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?	Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.	Think it'll work?
Think it'll work?	Nah.
Nah.	Want company?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	I should probably write that down.
I should probably write that down.	Yeah.
Your phone number?	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
He was your friend.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
How?	Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --	I don't think I want to hear this --
I don't think I want to hear this --	Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Pike, please --	Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Maybe we shouldn't go.	The faggot speaks.
The faggot speaks.	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.	"Oh, yeah, ""Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on."" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland."
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --	Poor fucker my ass...
Poor fucker my ass...	You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Pike and I got separated --	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --	I remember now, it was before the explosion --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --	Oh, you remember now --
Oh, you remember now --	I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I was freezing from the hurricane --	So you took off your shirt?
So you took off your shirt?	To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
We just want --	"What, ""The Truth""? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem."
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.	He wanted more than that.
He said what?	"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."	No one else heard it?
No one else heard it?	He whispered it in my ear.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.	Because he'd shot Mueller.
Because he'd shot Mueller.	But you didn't see it, right?
But you didn't see it, right?	Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Pike never confessed.	We've been making progress, I see.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?	Fifty minutes.
Fifty minutes.	Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Pike never confessed.	No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Dunbar says you were.	Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --	You can't threaten me --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --	What?
It won't work --	It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Enjoy your flight to Washington --	Wait --
Wait --	What.
Dunbar's telling the truth.	Wrong answer --
Wrong answer --	We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Who, Levi --	Childs.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.	I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --	So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What happened with Nunez?	He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?	Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck happened to you --	What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --	Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Thank God...	What the fuck are you doing?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --	Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --	Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?	I used it to start the fire --
I used it to start the fire --	Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --	We're not going anywhere.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --	The fuck are you talking about --
The fuck are you talking about --	You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --	Bullshit --
Bullshit --	Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --	Shut up!
Tell him to shut up --	-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.	No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --	You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
So?	Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
This is totally unnecessary --	He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.	But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --	He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.	He's not Army, it's not official --
He's not Army, it's not official --	Then it's unofficial.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...	I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
You think he did it?	No --
What do you think?	It's too neat.
You want Kendall, don't you?	He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.	We know.
We know.	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
What happens to Dunbar now?	Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...	The army kicked you out for drugs...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!	Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!	Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!	Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!	In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

Sir, yes, sir!	So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?	Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!	LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Great, great. That's fantastic.	It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
See! The big guy likes it.	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.	Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.	I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.	Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?	Yes!
Yes!	I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.	Who is she? Where does she live?
Who is she? Where does she live?	Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.	Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.	I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Someone stole my backpack.	Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.	Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.	I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
Didn't kill anything, did I?	A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.	That would explain the indigestion.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.	There's only one I want.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Good luck, kid.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?	Edward Bloom.
Bloom like a flower?	Yes.
Yes.	Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
You were expecting me?	Not yet.
What is this place?	The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.	The poet? What ever happened to him?
The poet? What ever happened to him?	He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.	No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.	It truly is.
I have to leave. Tonight.	Why?
Why?	This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.	No one's ever left.
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.	Then do it.
Then do it.	Fine, I will.
Fine, I will.	Fine, you do it.
Fine, you do it.	Fine, I'm doing it.
You get the eye?	I brought it.
I brought it.	Let's see it.
Bloom!	Don.
Don.	What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!	I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Will.	Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.	A pleasure.
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.	My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
How long have you known my father?	Thirty years. Maybe more.
Thirty years. Maybe more.	How would you describe him?
How would you describe him?	Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?	A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.	Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?	No.
No.	Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
What did she look like?	Well, she... uh...
Well, she... uh...	Was she nekkid?
Yeah.	It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How old are you?	Eighteen.
Eighteen.	I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.	You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.	And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Promise me you'll come back.	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
You must be Edward Bloom.	How did you know?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.	Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.	So I've heard.
So I've heard.	I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
In so many words, yes.	Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.	It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
Helping people makes me happy.	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.	I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.	I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.	I see. I thank you for your time.
It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just...
Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
Please. Go. Just go.	I'll...
I'll...	Go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.	I know.
I know.	And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.	Lucky girl.
Lucky girl.	I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Really.	You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Hi. How are you feeling?	I was dreaming.
I was dreaming.	What were you dreaming about?
"Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead."	That's terrible.
That's terrible.	"Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your Grampa is going to die."" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead."
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.	No, I understand.
No, I understand.	He was slipping her a little extra cream.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.	Stop.
Stop.	They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Spooning the sherbet.	Can I take your picture?
Can I take your picture?	You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.	Please?
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.	I never knew.
I never knew.	Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.	Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?	Well, it's not a short one.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?	Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
There was one time when I was eleven...	You were talking about your wedding.
You were talking about your wedding.	I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	I like your stories.
I like your stories.	And I like you.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.	Really?
Really?	Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?	I can.
I can.	So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.	What's your name, Giant?
What's your name, Giant?	Karl.
Karl.	Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.	You don't like it?
You don't like it?	I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.	Okay.
What did she say?	Beats me.
You know anyone's who's taken it?	That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
You're not trying to run away?	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.	Make him stop.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?	I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.	Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.	Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?	Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.	No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
The one about the witch.	Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.	I'm not scared.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.	Am I?
Am I?	Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...	Did you do any of that?
Did you do any of that?	No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.	You think I'm up for it?
You think I'm up for it?	You learned from the best.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.
Really.	Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.	The Old Lady by the swamp.
The Old Lady by the swamp.	She was a witch.
She was a witch.	No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.	I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.	So how does it happen?
So how does it happen?	Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.	Okay.
Okay.	And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?	What did he say?
What did he say?	You owe me three-fifty.
You owe me three-fifty.	Really.
Really.	True story.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
There's a lot you don't know about me.	You're right.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.	You mean, while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.	I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...	I will.
I will.	You know where the chemicals are?
You know where the chemicals are?	I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I thought you weren't dying.	I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Why not religion, Dad?	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.
Did I ever tell you about how...	Yes.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.	I think someone hasn't.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...	Dad?
Dad?	Son?
Son?	Can we talk?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?	Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.	Dad!
Dad!	What?
What?	I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.	"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""
"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""	The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.	What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?	I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.	I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.	You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.

You think I'm fake.	Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.	It would kill you, huh?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.	I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The river.	The river?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
How what happens?	How I go.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.	Like this.
Like this.	Okay. Okay.
Let's get out of here.	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Where are we headed?	You say...
You say...	The River!
It's unbelievable.	Story of my life.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.	Yes. Exactly.
I'm sorry.	Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Oh.	But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Daffodils?	They're your favorite flower.
They're your favorite flower.	How did you get so many?
How did you get so many?	I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
You don't even know me.	I have the rest of my life to find out.
How can I convince you to stop?	Go out with me.
I was drying out.	I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Wait! I need those!	There is no softer ground than town.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.	Really.
Really.	There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This is why you don't show work in progress.	Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?	I can't imagine any place better than here.
I can't imagine any place better than here.	You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
It's me. Norther Winslow.	I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I don't believe it!	I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.	That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
So what are you up to now?	I'm robbing this place.
This is it? The whole vault.	'Fraid so.
'Fraid so.	Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
Hello.	I wasn't expecting you.
Are you Jenny Hill?	I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
How did you know my father?	This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Were you and my father having an affair?	Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?	Because he's dying.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.	My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.	No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.	You didn't become crazy.
You didn't become crazy.	Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --	Yes.
Yes.	Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.	We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.	I'll help you.
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...	I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Do you like it, being pregnant?	I do.
I do.	I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
It's bad.	It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.	You need to go.
You need to go.	Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
You don't have to.	I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
You never told me how your parents met.	They met at Auburn.
They met at Auburn.	What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.	That's because most of it never happened.
That's because most of it never happened.	But it's romantic.
Mmm.	Mmm, what?
Mmm, what?	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Do you love your father?	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.	Do you love him?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.	But it's not true.
But it's not true.	"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.	You're not.
You're not.	I need you on my side.
I need you on my side.	I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
What happened?	Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.	Is he going to be okay?
How did you get here?	We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.	Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.	We rented a car.
We rented a car.	You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
How is he?	He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.	How much time does he have left?
How much time does he have left?	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.	Really! That's wonderful.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?	Of course.
Of course.	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?	Yes.
Yes.	How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.	Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Would you say you understand Josephine?	Yes. But that's a different...
Yes. But that's a different...	No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.	Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.	True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.	But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.	Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Was she one of your teachers?	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.	Do you know who that is?
That really happened?	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Is he awake?	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Mom?	Yes?
Did you and Dad have any other property?	I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.	So you never bought any land.
So you never bought any land.	Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.	I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.	That's okay?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
You first.	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 拢150.	What for?
What for?	You know what for.
You know what for.	No I don't.
No I don't.	I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.	I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.	Such as?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?	Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff	I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah it was okay.	Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.	The sets were good.
The sets were good.	The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.	There's over eighty thousand here.
It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.	Do you want to stop?
Do you want to stop?	Yes.
Yes.	We'll stop then.
What's this?	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.	That's not a burn.
That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.
Do you like it?	Yeah.
Say thank you.	Thank you.
What?	You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?	Name it.
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.	Leave him!
Leave him!	You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.	No I haven't.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.	Ch...
Ch...	To customers approaching the bank from the rear
To customers approaching the bank from the rear	Right.
Right.	You can see why it's sensitive?
You can see why it's sensitive?	Uh... Yes.
Hello.	I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.

How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?	You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.	What are you doing here?
Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
I'm asking what you're here for.	What?
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
I need to know who you are first please.	Oh.  We are Russian.
Oh.  We are Russian.	Yes. I know.
Yes. I know.	Good.
Good.	And...
And...	And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Hold on.	Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?	Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.	Right.
Right.	We better watch him. He's crazy.
We better watch him. He's crazy.	Right.
Right.	I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
No.	Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So?	So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What was that?	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.	Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
So how long will you be in England?	Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.	You must have a visa or something...
You must have a visa or something...	You're asking for my documents?
You're asking for my documents?	No, no...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!	Uh. Do you like England?
Uh. Do you like England?	Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?

"""I saw you waiting there, by the gate."""	I...
I...	"""I have these uh..."" She explains to you... ""When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses."" Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds."
Binoculars.	Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
What was that?	Oh nothing.
Oh nothing.	Tell me.
Tell me.	No. It is too judgmental.
No. It is too judgmental.	Tell me what he said.
Tell me what he said.	He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.	No. It's not that.
No. It's not that.	Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?	I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.	It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.	To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.

Yes.	Right. Okay. Good.
"It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand ""ants""?"	Yes.
Yes.	I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.	Yes.

What's wrong?	They go.
They go.	Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.	They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.	You don't understand anything.
You don't understand anything.	I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.	It's makes it easier. Okay.
It's makes it easier. Okay.	I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.	It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.	That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
So what are you going to do?	I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.	They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.	Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.	Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.	Well as it turns out I did.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.	No I don't.
No I don't.	In the world.
In the world.	I know you just want to punish me --
I know you just want to punish me --	I do. I want to very badly.
I do. I want to very badly.	So you're just going to be vindictive
So you're just going to be vindictive	In every sense. If at all possible.
In every sense. If at all possible.	You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.	Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Where's the restroom?	What?
What?	I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...	What? No you're not..

What?	Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?	Yes.
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
What?	I said I don't have any.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...	I don't want to talk about him.
I don't want to talk about him.	Fine.
Fine.	It's none of your business.
It's none of your business.	Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
So uh...	Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.	Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.	If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.	Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.	But, you know, so what?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.	He will come back.
He will come back.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.	Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.	No. But you tend to tie them up.
I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?
Why not?	Shut up. I'm not listening.
Shut up. I'm not listening.	You don't want to talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it.	No.
No.	Okay we won't talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?	I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.	Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.	And? What are you saying?
And? What are you saying?	And. It's wrong.
And. It's wrong.	And who says what is wrong.
And who says what is wrong.	And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.	What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.	So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..	"Whereas ""Wet 'n' Wild"" is an emotional journey. ""Tied and Tethered"". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."
"Whereas ""Wet 'n' Wild"" is an emotional journey. ""Tied and Tethered"". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."	Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?	Sometimes.
Sometimes.	Sometimes which?
Sometimes which?	Sometimes neither.
Sometimes neither.	Some... What does that mean?
Some... What does that mean?	There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.	I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.	Why?
Why?	Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.	So now you hate all women?
So now you hate all women?	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?	Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
What?	You...
You...	I got what I paid for.
I got what I paid for.	You didn't mind too much.
It wasn't what I wanted.	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?	You don't understand me.
You don't understand me.	You don't understand you either.
Excuse me?	Get out

Frank Abolofia.	The Wolf?
Some party.	Maybe we should do something?
Maybe we should do something?	Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
What are you doing?	Saving your life.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.	I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.	What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.	Beats forty hours on a plane.
Beats forty hours on a plane.	They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.	Not a prayer.
Not a prayer.	Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
What'd you say?	Where is the subway station, please.
Nick... You up?	No.
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.	Go to sleep, Charlie.
Go to sleep, Charlie.	You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.	I didn't know.
I didn't know.	The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.	Hey, when in Rome --
Hey, when in Rome --	In Rome, I'll bow.
Let's go.	Nick, we can't just --
Nick, we can't just --	I said let's go, Charlie.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.	Let's grab some food.
Let's grab some food.	First decent idea you've had.
This should be it...	You said that in the last two places.
This the right place?	I hope not.
Getting very weird.	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.	Maybe we should bail?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.	Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...	Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Squid?	Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Joyce can be nice.	What'd she say?
What'd she say?	That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
You cool, Ich?	Cool?
Cool?	You all right?  You okay?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?	What does Charlie mean?
What does Charlie mean?	Hey, all right.
Short shift?	Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.	Connie...
Connie...	All right, how's the new partner?
All right, how's the new partner?	High spirits, desire, commitment.
High spirits, desire, commitment.	You'll take care of that.
You'll take care of that.	Give me a break, would you?
Give me a break, would you?	If you give me one.
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?
Where're you going, Ichiro?	The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
"""Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.""  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis."	Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.	No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.	That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!	What's the problem here?
Nick!	Give us a break...
Give us a break...	It's Ichiro.  Ich.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.	I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.	Why the hell not?
Why the hell not?	I don't, that's all.
What happened?	They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.	Why weren't you at the platform?
Why weren't you at the platform?	I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
You must leave?	Yeah...
Yeah...	I'll get him for you, Nick.
I've continued working on the case!	I can see that.
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
Know her?	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...	A snitch?
What's he saying?	He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.	Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'	No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!	Nick...
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
Did I say that?	You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.	Are we getting married?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?	Sure.
Nick...	If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --	Ichiro --
Ichiro --	Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --	Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Yakuza.	Good.  Very good...
She disappeared... shit!	You were too far behind.
You can't come in.  They don't want --	Gaiijin.
Gaiijin.	I'll check it out.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --	You can trust me.
I'm not drunk...	We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.	Nick --
Nick --	Shut-up.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.	I want to yank Kobo.
I want to yank Kobo.	Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.	San is an honorable title.
Nick!	A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Where does this Sugai live?	A resort city, Beppu.
A resort city, Beppu.	I want to go talk to him.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
What...?  Why?	Because he knows how to get to our man.
Because he knows how to get to our man.	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.	I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
It's very small.	Big enough.
Big enough.	It's illegal, Nick.
It's illegal, Nick.	It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?	Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
What's in the box?	For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.	So I bring some cheese?
No...	Let's go.  Him first.
Let's go.  Him first.	Nick, you can't do this.
Nick, you can't do this.	It's done.  You don't have to come.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.	No.
No.	Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Start it.	I can't...
Just one, compadre... Kampai.	Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.	I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.	I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.	How many men?
How many men?	I couldn't tell.
I couldn't tell.	Joyce?
Joyce?	I don't know.
I don't know.	We need the plate to negotiate with.
Someone attacked him.	Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
A wife.  She left.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Me too.
What's that for?	Luck.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
Why's that?	Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
You all right?	Yes...
Yes...	Call for help.
Louder, pal, louder.	Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
We can't lose.	How can you be so sure?
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.	Gaiijin?
Gaiijin?	An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.	I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.	I don't give tours.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.	You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	You have a helluva way of answering.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.	Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.	I don't think so.
She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
He's on duty.	I paid for that.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.	Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need your help, Joyce.	Where's Ich?
Where's Ich?	Unavailable.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.	I need someone to translate for me.
I need someone to translate for me.	My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.	It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.	And I'm supposed to care?
And I'm supposed to care?	You could fake it.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.	He drinks.
He drinks.	He's got a reason.
Where's the wife?	You met her.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.	What do you chant?
What do you chant?	'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.	Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?	I don't remember saying yes.
I don't remember saying yes.	I don't remember you saying no.
They want your autograph.	Who am I supposed to be?
Who am I supposed to be?	This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...	Tell them I'm not.
We're in?	The cheese...
You'll get Ich killed.	No one's keeping him here.
No one's keeping him here.	Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.	Why would you care?
I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?
What if I chant?	Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Can't make you change your mind?	Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.	Might be different in New York.
Might be different in New York.	Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.	I'd like that.
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...	Save it, I already took the tour.
Save it, I already took the tour.	You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.	Guess I'm on a roll.
Guess I'm on a roll.	She's such a long way home for you.
She's such a long way home for you.	Time, I've got plenty of.
This is my stop.	I'm amused.
I'm amused.	Don't be.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.	Then take it from him.
How big a package we talking about?	This by this...
This by this...	Dope?
Dope?	Not in that company.
Not in that company.	The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
One guy do all the damage?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.	Why?
Why?	He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.	What?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.	What...?  What if I say no?
What...?  What if I say no?	Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.	Why me?
Why me?	They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
It's not your job.	He was my partner.
He was my partner.	They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!	I planned on catching him, Captain.
I planned on catching him, Captain.	How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.	He killed a police officer.
He killed a police officer.	Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.	Right.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.	Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
It is not allowed.	We're police officers.
We're police officers.	You're foreigners.
You're foreigners.	Work with me.  I want your best detective.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.	Do you know what this is?
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Because I want you to tell me.	The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.	Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
What's this?	Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.	While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.	Look.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!	Twenty-four hours, detective.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.	For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!	You had my help, detective.
You had my help, detective.	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
If anything happens to her while I'm here --	-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.	I have to get to Sugai.
I have to get to Sugai.	Goodbye, officer.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.	I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --	-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.	I want him.
I want him.	He'll be dealt with.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.	The families who control the casinos?
The families who control the casinos?	Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.	The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.	Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Why tell me this?	The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.	You trust me?
You trust me?	I'll pay you.
With these?	Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.	If I say no?
If I say no?	You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.	I don't have to.
Good.	He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
You want him dead too.	After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...	We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.	You certainly have a nice place here.
You certainly have a nice place here.	Well stocked.
He knows what he's doing.	If he won't cooperate?
If he won't cooperate?	Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?	I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.	Pris?
Let's go while there is still time.	Where?
Where?	Anywhere.
What's the point?	Not to be trapped.
Not to be trapped.	You underestimate the trap, Mary.
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
Then go get him.	That wouldn't be very sporting.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.	Oh?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.	Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.	And what can he do for you?
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Can the maker repair what he makes?	Would you like to be modified?
Would you like to be modified?	Had in mind something a little more radical.
Had in mind something a little more radical.	What's the problem?
What's the problem?	Death.
Death.	I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
I want more life, fucker.	Come here.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.	Why?
Why?	Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.	What about E.M.S. recombination?
What about E.M.S. recombination?	We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.	Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.	But not to last.
But not to last.	Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.	I am?
I've done some questionable things.	Also extraordinary things.
Also extraordinary things.	Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?	Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.	If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...	Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.	Well, actually
Why are you staring at us?	You're just all so... so different.
What, Sebastian?	You're androids.
What generation are you?	Nexus - 6.
Show me something?	Like what?
Like what?	Like...
We have a lot in common.	You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?	Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.	Of course not.
Of course not.	You could help us.
You could help us.	I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.	If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?	Dr. Tyrell?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.	Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.	He could?
He could?	His company made us.
His company made us.	I'd be happy to mention it to him.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.	Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.	No.
No.	When do you deliver your project?
When do you deliver your project?	This afternoon.
You're our best and only friend.	Thank you.
Where are you going, Sebastian?	Just thought I'd...
Just thought I'd...	No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
He's not ready yet.	When?
When?	Tomorrow, he says.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.	Hello, glad to meet you.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I think, therefore I am.	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
I want to do it.	Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Six, huh?	Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.	What was he after?
What was he after?	There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
You got a machine on it yet?	We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.	Where do we start?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.	What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?	Industrial refuse.
Industrial refuse.	Garbage man?
Yeah.	Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.	I was just about to have my dinner.
I was just about to have my dinner.	If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
She was gonna get away.	Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.	Yeah.
Yeah.	This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?	Yeah.
Yeah.	She's not with you?
She's not with you?	Who.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.	Got it.
Got it.	Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?	Yeah.  I got it.
Yeah.  I got it.	Go.
It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
Soon as I finish the job.	When might that be?
When might that be?	Day after tomorrow.
Day after tomorrow.	Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.	This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
You equipped for random questions?	Why, yes, of course.
Why, yes, of course.	You start.
You start.	The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?	How do I stop one?
How do I stop one?	Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,	Okay, but...
Okay, but...	I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.	I know all that.
I know all that.	What about a summary then.
What about a summary then.	I think we're through for the night.
Yes?	Do you have something against science?
Do you have something against science?	Not if it works.
Not if it works.	And what in your estimation works?
And what in your estimation works?	The umbrella.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...	Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?	Longevity is classified.  No.

I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
It's okay.  Forget it.	But I would like to buy you drink.
But I would like to buy you drink.	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?	Vodka!
Vodka!	Shot of vodka, please.
Shot of vodka, please.	Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.	My pleasure.
Prosit.	Prosit.
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
Sorry, don't have the time.	No problem.
Those cockroaches?	Ya.
How long you had these guys?	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Prosit.	Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
I like you.	I like you too.
I like you too.	One more, eh?
One more, eh?	I gotta piss.
How old am I?	I don't know.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?	Four years.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?	Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?	I'm doing okay.
I'm doing okay.	From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?	Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.	Money?
Money?	No.  I got a problem.
No.  I got a problem.	Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
What's that?	I'm taking a piss.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.	These aren't just...
These aren't just...	I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Nerves of steel.	No rust?
No rust?	I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.	Meaning?
Meaning?	Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
During the road test...	Yeah?
Yeah?	Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.	Huh huh.
Huh huh.	Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.	True.
But you haven't put in for emigration.	Nope.
Nope.	You're going to be over the limit.
You're going to be over the limit.	Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.	What if you change your mind?
What if you change your mind?	They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.	You sure?
You sure?	Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Why didn't you go?	Too old.
Too old.	But if you could?
My job is here.	Me too.
Taffey Lewis?	Yes?
Yes?	Can I come in?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.	Of course.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?	Do you recognize any of them?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...	What did she want?
What did she want?	Who?
Who?	The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.	Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.	What night?
What night?	I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.	What's suck night?
What's suck night?	That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.	You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Book the good ones for where?	Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.	What shows?
What shows?	Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Yeah?	I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.	I don't know nothing about it.
I don't know nothing about it.	You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
How do you mean 'exploited'?	Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?	Are you for real?
Are you for real?	Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.	What the fuck for?
What the fuck for?	For holes.
It that mother real?	Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?	It's a good job.
It's a good job.	You mean the snake.
The best.	Does it eat?
Does it eat?	Come on.
Jeezus!	Sorry.
Sorry.	Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.	I bet I would.
I bet I would.	Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.	A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.	But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
It's artificial?	Of course not.
Are you apprehensive?	Why should I be?
Why should I be?	For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.	You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd take him to the doctor.	You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.	I'd kill it.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.	Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?	You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.	I'd never get an abortion.
I'd never get an abortion.	Why not?
Why not?	That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.	In your opinion.
In your opinion.	It would be my child.
It would be my child.	Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.	Ugh.
Is there anything else?	I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.	I've already got more help than I need.
I've already got more help than I need.	I think you need more help than you've got.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.	Two of us might be more effective than one.
Two of us might be more effective than one.	I work alone.
You use your equipment, don't you?	So?
So?	So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Do I make you nervous?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I'm sorry.
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made.	Right.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.	What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?	Sit.
You ever take a bath with a man before?	There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
You did?	You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
Me and my dad.	Where is he?
Where is he?	Dead.
Dead.	Oh.
How come you're not on the job?	I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.	How are you doing?
How are you doing?	Not too good.
What do people do in the afternoon?	If they are smart, they take naps.
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
Yeah.  Sometimes.	I wish I could.
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
Yeah.	That's another thing I can't do.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.	It wasn't very good last night, was it?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?	I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.	What?
What?	I don't know... I think I missed something.
I don't know... I think I missed something.	Like?
Like?	I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?	Hmmm?
Hmmm?	Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?	Don't be fooled by appearances.
Don't be fooled by appearances.	It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
They could clean around the arrangement.	I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...	Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.	But then how can you...
But then how can you...	I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
This feels stupid.	Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
You're sick, Deckard.	I never felt better.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
You mean a woman?	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	What's a long time?
What's a long time?	Ten years.
Ten years.	Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?	Because it's not.
Because it's not.	Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?	Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.	Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?	No, I don't.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.	What difference will it make?
What difference will it make?	Just wait here.
You know what I think?	What?
What?	That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Where the hell you been?	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.	Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.	What's up?
What's up?	Holden got hit.
Bad?	Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.	I'll see you in a minute.
Thanks.	Black?
Black?	Please.
Is this to be an empathy test?	Yes.
Yes.	Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
May I ask a personal question?	Go ahead.
Go ahead.	Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?	No.
No.	But in your profession that is a risk.
But in your profession that is a risk.	Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.	Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?	One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?	Sitting next to you.
Well?	If she is, the machine works.
If she is, the machine works.	The machine works.  She is.
How many questions did it take?	Thirteen.
She didn't know?	Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?	Discreetly.
Discreetly.	All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.	Sorry.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.	How do you know I'm not?
How do you know I'm not?	You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.	I'm tired of this.
I'm tired of this.	Almost through.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.	Don't move.
Don't move.	Sorry.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...	Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...	What one?
What?	What desert?
What desert?	Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.	But how come I'd be there?
But how come I'd be there?	Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...	A tortoise.  What's that?
A tortoise.  What's that?	Know what a turtle is?
Know what a turtle is?	Of course.
Of course.	Same thing.
Same thing.	I never seen a turtle.
But I understand what you mean.	You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
What's your name?	Pris.
Pris.	Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.	Hi.
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
I don't have one.	Oh.
Where are your folks?	They left.
They left.	What about friends?
What about friends?	I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
I'm hungry, J.F.	I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?	I was hoping you'd say that.
Whatcha doin'?	You scared me.
You look... better.	Just better.
Just better.	Beautiful.
Beautiful.	Thanks.
And you live in this building all by yourself?	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Twenty.	What's your problem?
Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
What's that?	My glands.  They grow old too fast.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
Is that why you're still here?	Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?	As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.	Good.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.	I keep a lot of provisions right here.
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
Hi!	Yes?
Yes?	I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
You like it?	Bravo!
Bravo!	Thank-Q!
This is my new friend...	I'm Adam Webber.
I'm Adam Webber.	He's really funny!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.	Really?
You're kidding!	No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.	Your mom was a dancer?
Your mom was a dancer?	She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?	Sure.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.	How do you do?
How do you do?	Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.	Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.	Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.	Come where?
Come where?	My office.
My office.	For how long?
For how long?	Well, that depends...
Well, that depends...	I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Let's go talk first, Adam.	Yes, ma'am.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!	Young man, stop right there!
How do you do?	I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.	Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--	How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Please excuse this interruption.	Oh, brother...
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?	What?!
What?!	I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?	Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.	Do ya?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.	It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.	Eve? I'm leaving.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!	Are you French?
Are you French?	No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.	Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Where are we going?	We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.	No, I'm lost.
No, I'm lost.	You're lost?
You're lost?	Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.	Dickhead?
Dickhead?	A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
I just had a mental picture of...	Here, pick these up!
I came on a bus.	Why doesn't that surprise me?
Why doesn't that surprise me?	I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.	Oh, that's nice.
Oh, that's nice.	Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
So far?	Yes, I'm right?
Yes, I'm right?	Right.
Right.	I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?	Again.
Again.	Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?	Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!	See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!	It was amazing.
It was amazing.	Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.	Do you own a car?
Do you own a car?	I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.	If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.	You don't?
You don't?	Nope.
Nope.	Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!	Get away from me!!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!	Rogers Hornsby?!?
Rogers Hornsby?!?	He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!	So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.
Yes.	And that's it?
And that's it?	Yes.

Thank-Q!	Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.

...Okay.	It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.

I've got goose-bumps all over me.	Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?	1959.
1959.	Who use to own it?
Who use to own it?	Russia.
Russia.	When did we get it from them?
When did we get it from them?	1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

I don't think so.	You don't have a computer in your cabin?

Yeah?	Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.	He's a Windows guy then, huh?

Yes. He likes windows.	Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?	...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.

Not on him.	I'm not wearing his pants.
I'm not wearing his pants.	Why not? He has great pants.
Why not? He has great pants.	I just don't want to.
I just don't want to.	Okay.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?	No.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.	Almost all of them.
Almost all of them.	The recovery is very impressive.

What?!	Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.	Okay. Thank you, my friends.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.	No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!	How 'bout we check with Eve first?

Good-bye, Adam.	Goodbye.
Bye, Troy!	Bye, Adam!
Bye, Adam!	And thanks for always being happy!
And thanks for always being happy!	What?
You dial nine to get out.	Of what?

Up there!!	I don't see anything!
I don't see anything!	Just look!!
Help you?	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?	Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.	Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger!

Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything!

Sure.	Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?	Gladly.
Whatcha looking at?	Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!	Say what?!
Say what?!	How do you do, ma'am.
How do you do, ma'am.	I do alright.
I do alright.	Good!
Hello.	Hi.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?	I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.	Really? No kidding?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.	I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.	Oh, that would be wonderful!
Oh, that would be wonderful!	Well, we're here to help!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.	Oh, you got a problem with that?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.	Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Yes, ma'am.
Elbows, Son.	Sorry, Mom!
Sorry, Mom!	You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Dad!	Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.	I'll go up.
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.	You're my brave boy.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.	Yes, ma'am.
Right.	I just hope this is still good up there.
I just hope this is still good up there.	Mom?
Yes?	I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.	Yes, ma'am.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.	Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.	Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.	Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.	Are you in trouble, son?!
Are you in trouble, son?!	I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.	A psychiatrist?!
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.	What?
What?	I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
This is your bedroom?	No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.	Well, where are you --
Well, where are you --	Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.	No.
No.	Yes.
Oh, my God!	He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.	No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!	I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--	No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--	Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.	You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.	And now you must let me be the judge of that!
And now you must let me be the judge of that!	I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...	Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.	Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.

All back East.	The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.	He drank it hot?
He drank it hot?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Good god.
Good god.	Yeah.
You got a light, honey?	What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!	Good.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?	"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""
"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""	Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?	"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."
"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."	"Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  ""Boy?""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?"""

Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!	Really?
Really?	Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.	No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!	Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.	Well, put it down and come in!
Well, put it down and come in!	You bet, hon!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!	We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
It's time.	Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
It shuts off automatically.	Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.	No.  They all do.
No.  They all do.	I never know anymore.
You hear that?!	Yes.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.	I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.	Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.	Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?	Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?	Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
How long will we have to stay down here?	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.	Days??
Days??	Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!	But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.	I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.	Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.	Yes, dear!
Yes, dear!	As long as we've got that straight.
Home sweet home!	To you maybe.
What's that noise?	The locks.
The locks.	The locks?
The locks?	To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.	Thirty -five years!
Thirty -five years!	Then after that it's safe.
Then after that it's safe.	It's safe.
To go up.	To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?	No.
No.	We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.	All our friends...
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.	I'm not hungry.
I'm not hungry.	Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!	No, Calvin, you're favorite.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.	Really?
Maybe I've just got the creeps.	How could you?! This is just like home!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!	Would you like a tranquilizer?
Would you like a tranquilizer?	You have tranquilizers?
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, no.	What?
What?	Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.	Honey?
Is there a problem?	No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.	I've noticed.
I've noticed.	What shall we call him?
No.  I think it's just right.	And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...	Yes!
Yes!	If I...you know...
If I...you know...	What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Calvin?!	Right here!
Right here!	We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.	Why?
Why?	No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!	Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.	Yes.  Well... yes.
Watch this!	What?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!	Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.	Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.	Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi, honey!	Hi.
Calvin!	Coming!
Get the presents and do the lights.	You bet.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	And I made these!
What did you wish for, Adam?	If he tells, it won't come true!
If he tells, it won't come true!	Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!	Well, we did in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.	Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Let's eat our cake.	Yeah. Let's dig in!
If we still have one.	Yes...
Yes...	You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?	Would you excuse me?
Would you excuse me?	Sure.
In the generator room again?	Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.	I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Should we say a little prayer first?	Just open the door.
Yes, yes it is!	"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."	Yes! That's right!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.	Mutants?!
Mutants?!	It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.	No.
No.	Yes.
Yes.	I don't believe it!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.	Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?	We stay down here.
We stay down here.	We do?
We do?	Yes.
Yes.	Excuse me.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!	We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--	No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!	Well, I am the head of this household--
Well, I am the head of this household--	I want him to at least see the sky!
I want him to at least see the sky!	--and we will--
--and we will--	And the ocean!  A mountain range!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!	--do as I say!
He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.	Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?	I thought ten years.
I thought ten years.	Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...	To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...	Some time.
Some time.	What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you bitching about now?	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	I forgot some of my stuff.
I forgot some of my stuff.	Your stuff?  Let me see that.
You came back for these?	Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?	This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.	Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
So where is your roommate, the model?	You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.	Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
I knew you'd like him.	Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?	Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.	Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.	I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Give me your hand.	Oh, my God...
But first, you have to start with the clothes!	Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I don't know.	Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
You're serious, aren't you?	What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to mean?	It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.	Well, that's blunt!
Well, that's blunt!	I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.	And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?	"I see ""elegant."""
"I see ""elegant."""	Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?	That's what I'm sensing.
Alright, I will.	I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.	What do you think, Adam?
Well, what do you think?	I think...it...works.
I think...it...works.	Let me show you the entire trousseau!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?	No.
That water's freezing!	He's from Alaska.
Just be yourself.	Always good advice.
Always good advice.	For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!	Eve?!
Eve?!	Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.	"Adam,  I think for you, we should go for ""sweet."""
Um... Eve?	It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Go to the bathroom.	Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
He go back to the hotel?	Uh..he might of.
What's that mean?	We did not leave together.
We did not leave together.	Who did he leave with?
What's it to you?!	I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?	Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.	Those sluts!
Those sluts!	Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Where are you going?	To bed.
To bed.	To bed?
To bed?	Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.	What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.	Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.	And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!	Uh, yes, you do.
Uh, yes, you do.	Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!	Yes, you do!
Yes, you do!	Or have perfect table manners.
Or have perfect table manners.	You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?

What?	He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!	Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.	Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...

Where did he get all that information?	From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.	So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.	He didn't leave with them.
He didn't leave with them.	Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.	He left with Sophie.
He left with Sophie.	What?!!
What?!!	It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.	Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?	You're goddamn right I am!
I don't think so.	Coward!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!	I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh, no!	What?!
Gay.	Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?	Fallout shelter.
What do you want to do with it?	Give it back to him.
Give it back to him.	And if we can't find him?
And if we can't find him?	We'll find him.
What's wrong?	I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!	See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!	Have him committed.
Have him committed.	Yeah! That's thinking.
Yeah! That's thinking.	"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"
"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"	I don't know. I like to think so.
I don't know. I like to think so.	Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!	To get some frozen poultry.
To get some frozen poultry.	Then what?
Then what?	We came back to the house!
We came back to the house!	You didn't stop anywhere else?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!	No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.	What?!

An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?	Come on.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?	None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.

I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.	I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?	He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

That's too bad.	What do you know about the ear? Anything?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?	Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?	Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?	I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

Do you know who was brought in for questioning?	There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?	Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.	I guess you have to get back home soon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?	Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.	Where are they?
Where are they?	I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?	I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.	Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?	My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

You really do hear a lot, don't you?	Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?	I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.	Still, it must be kinda rough.
Still, it must be kinda rough.	It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
What happened to him?	I don't know. He moved away.
I've gotta go in.	Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess I'll see you sometime.	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.	Yeah. Good bye.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?	I don't know.
I don't know.	I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'd like to talk to you about something.	Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
I'm here, aren't I?	I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?	It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.	Now, how are you going to do that?
Now, how are you going to do that?	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.	What will I say when she comes to the door?
What will I say when she comes to the door?	"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"
"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"	I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.	Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.	You've got a point there.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?	Alright.
Alright.	Let's go.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?	Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.	Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.	Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?	No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?	Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, if it opens the door.	Yeah.
So, what's next?	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?	I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.	You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?	Yes. I do.
Yes. I do.	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.	"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."
"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?	Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.	Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
What's the plan.	First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.	Brilliant.
Brilliant.	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.	This is not my usual Friday night!
That sounds good.	Two.
Here's to. An interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Why not?	It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.	It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?	Yeah, but.
Yeah, but.	Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?	OK.
OK.	Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.

Yeah.	I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.	Are you sure?
Are you sure?	I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay, thanks.	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.	That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?	Okay, okay. Bye.
Well, how did it go? What happened?	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

What's with Mike?	He got a little jealous.
He got a little jealous.	I'm sorry, I didn't...
I'm sorry, I didn't...	It's okay. Don't worry about it.
You want a Dairy Queen?	No way. I'm about to blow up.
You want to tell me about it?	"OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the ""yellow man"". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."

Wow. Should you tell my father?	I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.	You saw a lot in one night.
You saw a lot in one night.	Actually. I've been in twice.
Actually. I've been in twice.	Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?	Yes.
Yes.	Did you see her undressed?
Did you see her undressed?	Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.	Yeah?
Yeah?	That doesn't bother you, does it?
That doesn't bother you, does it?	Who, me? Why should it?

That's what I thought.	You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?	I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.

You want to go talk to him?	Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.	That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?	Shoot.
Shoot.	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?	Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.	Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.	Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?	Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.

Probably not. No. Why?	Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

You can change it if you want to.	I don't know why we have to watch TV.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.	Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?	Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.	Stop it Mike.
Stop it Mike.	You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
What did he bring him in for?	Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.	Just for him?
Just for him?	Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.	Up where?
Up where?	Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.	Oh fuck!
Fuck you.	Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.	I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Hey, I just...	Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?	I need Il Duce.
I need Il Duce.	The Duke?  What did you do?
The Duke?  What did you do?	This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.	Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
There's ways around that.	Go find one.
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
Mother Mary, full of grace.	What did you do, Connor?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.	Yes mother.
Yes mother.	I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants.

Are ya ready?	Aye.
Yes sir.	Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.	I can't find the second one, sir.
I can't find the second one, sir.	Look under the body.
Look under the body.	Got it.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?	Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.	Any tips on where these guys may be?
Any tips on where these guys may be?	Any word back from the E.R.s?

The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?	You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!	Where's your gun?

What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!	Get a hold of yourself, man.
Anybody you think is evil?	Yes.
Yes.	Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?	Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.	Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.	Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.	You sound real remorseful.

Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.	You think they sold me out? No way.
You think they sold me out? No way.	He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?

No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.	Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.	No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!	What happened?
What happened?	I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.	Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Anybody see ya?	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Yeah, well...	Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?

Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.	No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.	Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.	Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.

Look again for fuck sake!	I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?

You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.	Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.	Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.	You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
You guys?	We're here brother.
We're here brother.	You gotta keep going.

Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.	Ma, what's wrong?
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.	Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.	What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?

Nine bodies.	Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.	Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.	Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
Yes.	Then what the fuck?
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
So what do you think?	I'm strangely comfortable with it.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.	So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Give the guy a shot.	Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?	A-fuckin'-men!
"That's the guy that got us off the hook with the ""Checkov"" thing."	And he is one smart man.
He isn't to be touched.	He's a good man.
Now, you will receive us.	We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.

Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.	These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.	There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.	For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.

I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.	Okay then... let's get ya started.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...	Rule of thumb?
Rule of thumb?	Yeah?
Yeah?	Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!	Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?	Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.	Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
And number three, Dolly.	Uh... two shooters!
Uh... two shooters!	Fan-fuckin-tastic!
So, what do we do now?	That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
She was in here when it went down.	Can she I.D. them?
Can she I.D. them?	They were wearing masks.
They were wearing masks.	Of course they were. How many?
Of course they were. How many?	Three.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?	Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.	No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.	That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?	How do you figure?
How do you figure?	Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!	Rocco!
What?	Where's my cat?
Where's my cat?	I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!	You... oh god, why?
You... oh god, why?	I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!	You killed my... my...
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!	My, my...
My, my...	Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...	Pee...Per...Man.
Pee...Per...Man.	Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!	It was... It was...
It was... It was...	Male or female, bitch?!!
So what are you thinkin' here?	Really want to know?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.	These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...	The what man?
The what man?	The fat man.
The fat man.	Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?	He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.	And the pennies?
And the pennies?	New hitman wants to leave his mark
New hitman wants to leave his mark	That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.	Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.	The Greeks. The Italians.
The Greeks. The Italians.	The Sicilians.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.	They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.	Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!	What about one guy with two guns?
What about one guy with two guns?	Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?	It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.	And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.	No way they could have seen it?
No way they could have seen it?	Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.	What?
What?	A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.	Why was I not informed of this?
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?	Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.	Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.	Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.	Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.	Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?	Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Who the...	Twist of lemon!
Twist of lemon!	Chief, what the fuck is this?
Chief, what the fuck is this?	Sweet-n-low!
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?	Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?	Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
How many bodies, Greenly?	Eight.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?	Shit! Shit!
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...	It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?	Witness?
Witness?	No way they could have seen it.
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.	Who were the victims?
Who were the victims?	A couple of peons for the mob and...
A couple of peons for the mob and...	Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
What if it was just one guy with six guns?	Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
What the...?	I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Oh my god!	I...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.	Just called ta torture us did ya?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.	Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Promise me boys.	We promise.
Right now.	Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?	Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.	So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.	We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.	Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.	What are you serious?
What are you serious?	Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.	Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!	Fuck you!
Fuck you!	Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!	Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.	I'll be back at 9:00.
Hello?	Hey Murph.

Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!	You sure you killed them?
Liberating isn't it?	Y'know it is, a bit.
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.	So?
So?	So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.	Well, what'ya do?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.	Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Worst day of my life, man.	Well, I'm sold.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!	Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.	What the fuck do you mean?
What the fuck do you mean?	I mean he ain't here.
You bet your ass he will.	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.	We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
We'll keep going, Roc.	You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Hello? You there?	Y-Yes my son.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?	Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.	What is it my son?
What is it my son?	It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.

God's permission? God doesn't...
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.	You believe?
You believe?	Yes.
Yes.	You feel?
You feel?	Yes.
Yes.	You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Has he now?	You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?	I guess not.
I guess not.	It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You're right.	Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.	I want to stand for what I believe in, father.

Then you must find out what your beliefs are.	I believe these young men are right.
I believe these young men are right.	You know them personally?
You know them personally?	Yes.
Yes.	Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?	No. They would never do that.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.	Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.	Forgive me father.
Forgive me father.	Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
You gonna do what I say, got it?	Yes.
Yes.	I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.	Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Don't do this my son.	Open it!
Open it!	Have you no fear of God?
Have you no fear of God?	That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Father, I'll do you right here.	God have mercy on my soul.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?	Just be natural, goddamit.
Just be natural, goddamit.	How long since your last confession, my son?
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.	Just go!
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?	Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.	Yeah boss?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?	The... The funny man.
The... The funny man.	The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.	Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.	He's a nigger.
He's a nigger.	"Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, ""Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys..."
Continue the joke.	"He says, ""What's your third wish?"" And the guys says, ""I-I want you to beat me half to death."""
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.	Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.	Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.	Fuck you Vincenzo.
Fuck you Vincenzo.	Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.	I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
What color hair does he have?	Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.	Making Hutch David Soul?
Making Hutch David Soul?	Right. The blond guy.
Right. The blond guy.	OK. That's wrong.
OK. That's wrong.	Dignan, it's --
Dignan, it's --	Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?	He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.	I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.	No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Why?	As part of his plan. I don't know why.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.	See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.	The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.	What does Starsky say?
What does Starsky say?	He says. This is he.
He says. This is he.	This is he?
This is he?	No. This is he.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.	That's true. But what if they change the locks?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?	Would they do that?
Would they do that?	Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.	See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's really kind of hot.	She's an attractive older woman.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.	What do you think the cops have?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.	But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?	I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
"The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. ""Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."""	Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.	That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.	Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.	Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
Where are you going?	I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.	How was I ridiculing you?
How was I ridiculing you?	You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.	That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
Yeah, I saw it.	I'm lookout.
I'm lookout.	Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.	I don't think so. Just reach on in.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.	That sets it off.
That sets it off.	No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
It had an alarm.	Yeah, I heard that.
Yeah, I heard that.	Five, seven, eight dollars.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.
Eight dollars.	That's not bad.
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
Is it back in?	Yeah.
Loop around real fast.	Just turn right here.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --	You think we're going to be chased?
You think we're going to be chased?	That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!	Nothing. Go ahead.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!	No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Dignan, calm down.	You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!	Dignan! Stop!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
Where's the manager?	Where's the other stocker?
Where's the other stocker?	There's another stocker, right?
There's another stocker, right?	We know there's another stocker.
Is that the manager?	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
What about what that guy said?	Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
Like he meant it.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.	Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What's wrong with him?	What do you think?
What do you think?	Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.	He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.	I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --	Don't even say it, man.
Can I get that credit card from you?	I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.	Why not?
Why not?	Because my mom gets the bill.
Because my mom gets the bill.	She's not going to notice, Anthony.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.	I don't want to use it.
I don't want to use it.	Well, then cut it in half.
Well, then cut it in half.	I keep it for emergencies.
I keep it for emergencies.	Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
See if mine are in there.	Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.	Yes, they are.
Yes, they are.	Look at the treads on those.
Look at the treads on those.	What about them?
What about them?	They obviously weren't designed for racing.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.	Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.	You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.	That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.	Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.	You were spoiled rotten.
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
I'll say it.	OK. Go ahead.
OK. Go ahead.	On your marks...  Get set go.
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.	No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.	It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.	I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.	Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.	It's not a plan. It's just --
It's not a plan. It's just --	Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.	Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.	True.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?	Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.	Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.	No. We didn't.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.	Hi.
Hi.	Inez, this is --
Inez, this is --	Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
May I have a word with you, please?	Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
What. What's the matter?	Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?	No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.	They don't?
They don't?	No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.	Which one was that?
Which one was that?	On the left.
She's from Cuba.	No kidding.
He needs to hire an attorney.	No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.	As long as he gets out OK.
As long as he gets out OK.	Obviously. That's a given.
Obviously. That's a given.	Bob?
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.	This was in fourth grade.
This was in fourth grade.	Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.	They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.	Yes... It's true.
He's gone. He stole the car.	Where was it parked?
Where was it parked?	Right here.
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
Maybe he just went to the store.	He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.
We said 48 hours.	That's a long time to be in jail.
When'd he tell you?	This morning.
This morning.	Where was I?
Where was I?	You were asleep.
You were asleep.	He told you and you let him do it.
He told you and you let him do it.	He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.	If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?	Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?	So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --	Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.	I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.	If you say so.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.	I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.	Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.	No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Why don't you come with us.	OK.
I can't believe he just jumped you.	Can you hand me those french fries.
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.	We need a car.
I have an idea for that.	What?
What?	Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?	I don't think we can do that.
I don't think we can do that.	I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --	What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.	She doesn't need to know.
She doesn't need to know.	I don't know, Dignan. I just --
I don't know, Dignan. I just --	Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.	Shh.
Shh.	No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --	Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.	You don't know how to hotwire.
You don't know how to hotwire.	Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.	Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.	No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I think we better go home.	Don't panic, Anthony.
Don't panic, Anthony.	I'm not. But there's --
I'm not. But there's --	You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --	Our money situation is not good.
Our money situation is not good.	"You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --"
"You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --"	We've got sixteen dollars.
We've got sixteen dollars.	That's not correct.
Sixteen dollars.	I know.
I know.	Where's the rest?
I had to give some to Inez.	How much?
How much?	$383.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?	She needed it.
She needed it.	A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!	Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.	That's what she is!
That's what she is!	I know that. But --
I know that. But --	You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!	Shut up!
Shut up!	What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
Who's in the car?	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?	Sure.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.	You really hit a guy with a bottle?
I want you to look at this.	What is it?
What is it?	It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.	What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.	Who's Mr. Henry?
Who's Mr. Henry?	You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
What time did he say to be here?	Right now.
You could give somebody a concussion.	Let me feel that.
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
Dignan. Take it easy.	Bob!
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.	No, Dignan. This isn't --
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Shit, Dignan.	What the fuck are we doing out here?
What the fuck are we doing out here?	I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?	Eleven fifteen.
Eleven fifteen.	OK. Mark that down.
OK. Mark that down.	I did.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.	Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yeah. It's pretty good.	It's like we've finally arrived.
Next week we'll be drinking pi帽a coladas.	Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.	I don't think you will.
I don't think you will.	I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.	Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.	I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
Do you like Inez?	As a person?
As a person?	Yeah. As a girl.
Yeah. As a girl.	Yes. I do.
Yes. I do.	So do I.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.	Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.	You're all clear.
You're all clear.	Roger.
Roger.	We all set?
We all set?	Hang on a second.
Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
Take your second position.	OK. Roger.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.	Any activity?
Any activity?	Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.	Good. It's supposed to be.
Good. It's supposed to be.	I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --	Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't know.	Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
What's happening? What's going on?	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?	It's going back down.
It's going back down.	Applejack! What's happening?
Freeze!	Nobody move!
Nobody move!	Get against the wall!
Help me move him.	Careful. Check his pulse.
Who tripped the alarm?	It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.	Where's Kumar?
Where's Kumar?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
What are you doing?	Let's go. Come on.
Wait for Kumar.	Come on, Kumar.
You're kidding.	Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on.	I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.	What?
What?	I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I'll get him.
I'll get him.	There's not enough time.
There's not enough time.	Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Dignan, it's too late.	I don't think so.
Like amnesia.	Can't remember shit. CRS.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?	I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.	He did?
He did?	Yeah.
Yeah.	You got to be kidding me.
You got to be kidding me.	I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.	What'd he get?
What'd he get?	Pretty much everything.
Pretty much everything.	The grandfather clock?
You think Applejack knew?	We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Why?	We're not sure.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Nothing.
You're living on a sailboat?	It belongs to Bob's uncle.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.	How big is it?
How big is it?	Oh, I'd say about --
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
Does it float?	We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
So how is it in there?	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
What's he in for?	He stole a tractor.
I think I may have found a way out of here.	You're kidding.
You're kidding.	No. I'm not.
No. I'm not.	How?
How?	Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.	Dignan, I --
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.	What?
What?	Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --	Dignan, I --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:	Scale the --
Scale the --	Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.	Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.	That's a sharp jacket.
That's a sharp jacket.	Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.	It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.	Thanks.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.	Grammar.
You mean like techniques?	Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.	Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
You mean a safecracker?	Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.	So do I.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?	I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --	I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?	What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.	Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.	I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --	As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.	Hold it.
Congratulations. You passed the test.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
That was a test?	Take a deep breath.
How does that feel?	It feels good.
Did Dignan take the test?	Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.	How'd he do?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.	That sounds like Dignan.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?	Me?
Me?	No, that door over there.
No, that door over there.	I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.	Are you afraid?
Are you afraid?	Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.	Exactly. Woah.
Exactly. Woah.	Death.
Death.	The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?	No. Bob did.
No. Bob did.	Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.	Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?	Anthony, I'm petrified.
This is good.	I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.	Yeah.
Yeah.	It's an esoteric journey.
We're renegades from despair.	Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?	Absolutely.
Absolutely.	Why'd you want to help us?
Why'd you want to help us?	Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Future Man.	Who?
Who?	Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Did you ever steal a car before?	Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --	Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?	It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.	Hector woudn't do anything.
Hector woudn't do anything.	But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Could you grow cinnamon?	I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.	You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
See you.	See you, Bob.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.	There's a million places to hide around here.
There's a million places to hide around here.	Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.	I hope not.
I hope not.	Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Where you going?	Move.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.	I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.	Nobody does.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.	OK, Dad.
You think he got my license plates?	He looked too shaken-up.
How long are they going to hold him?	I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Anthony, I --	And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
What?	Is that OK?
Bob, where you going?	I'm not playing any more golf.
I'm not playing any more golf.	Why not?
Why not?	Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.	You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.	You think I'm improving?
You think I'm improving?	Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.
No, I don't mind.	I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.	Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.	That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.	I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.	Sixty days?
Sixty days?	Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.	Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?	Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.	Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.	Were you adopted, Bob?
Were you adopted, Bob?	Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?	Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.	No. I wasn't adopted.
Was Future Man adopted?	Jesus Christ! No.
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
Yeah. Let's keep it --	Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Give him a second.	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
You OK, Bob?	No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?	Nothing. I was just asking.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?	Sure.
What are you doing?	My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.	Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?	No.
Jesus, Bob.	I didn't do anything.
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --	His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
It's in the driveway.	Temporarily.
How do you say nineteen?	Dies y nueve.
Dies y nueve.	Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?	No.
No.	It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Were you born in Mexico?	Cuba.
Cuba.	Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?	God, yes. Like silk.
What?  What?	Like silk?
Like silk?	God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.	You're Anthony?
You're Anthony?	Yeah.
Yeah.	I hear you're a good thief.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?	Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.	S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?	Uh-uh.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.	Abdul-Shabazz?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Feel this.
Where'd they come from?	The front stairs.
The front stairs.	Where were you?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.	Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.	Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.	That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.	We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.	Is that Buckethead?
Is that him?	Wait a second.
That's Anthony.	That's your friend Anthony?
That's your friend Anthony?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What's he doing here?
What's he doing here?	Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Wait. Did he see us?	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?	Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.	Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.	You don't celebrate til it's over.
You don't celebrate til it's over.	True.
What?	Bob! Get back in position!
Are you a fag?	You're the faggot.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.	I don't know about that.
I don't know about that.	Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.	It seemed like a good idea at the time.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	The one and only Little Richard.
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
I'm not allowed to drive those.	Not even for emergencies?
Not even for emergencies?	No.
No.	I thought your parents were in Italy.
I thought your parents were in Italy.	They are.
They are.	So who's going to know?
So who's going to know?	My brother.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.	That never would of --
That never would of --	Let's cut the bullshit.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
What are you talking about, Bob?	Can you use a coaster.
You stole a Trans-Am.	Yes. I did.
Yes. I did.	OK, Bob.
OK, Bob.	It's true, Dignan.
It's true, Dignan.	Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?	I'll just drive my car.
How much could you grow? Realistically.	As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.	Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.	You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.	You're paranoid, Bob.
You're paranoid, Bob.	Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
I can't believe you said that.	What did I say?
What did I say?	I told you he's crazy.
The guy is fucking insane.	I warned you, Dignan.
I warned you, Dignan.	You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.	No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.	I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.	Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.	I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
I'm going to take a look at this.	Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.	That's my responsibility.
That's my responsibility.	That's your domain.
That's your domain.	OK.
Bob.	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.	What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!	I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
I paid for it.	God DAMMIT.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.	Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.	Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.	He electrocuted someone?
He electrocuted someone?	It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.	His name was Swifty?
His name was Swifty?	Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.	That's too bad.
That's too bad.	You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What happened?	Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.	This is natural.
This is natural.	That's good. Keep it at forty.
That's good. Keep it at forty.	Did we get it?
Did we get it?	Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!	No. I was calm.
You really think he'll remember you?	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
"I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, ""I'm going to remember you!"""	That's true. That would give me nightmares.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.	Bob, I've got nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
I told you they were there.	So it's my fault?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?	There were more than that.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?	He wouldn't move.
Is he chasing us?	I don't know.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.	It's registered in my mother's name.
It's registered in my mother's name.	What the fuck possessed you?
What the fuck possessed you?	You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
My brother's in jail.	What are you talking about?
The weed.	But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?	They said he's a drug dealer.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?	Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.	That could be anybody's.
That could be anybody's.	They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.	Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.	The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.	So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?	I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.	We'll have to see when we get back.
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.	Bob, that makes no sense.
Bob, that makes no sense.	Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.	This could be a trap.
This could be a trap.	Come on, Dignan.
Come on, Dignan.	"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."
"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."	I'm going back.
I'm going back.	Not in that car you're not.
Not in that car you're not.	Watch me.
Watch me.	Good luck, since I got the keys.
Give me the keys, Dignan.	I can't do that, Bob.
I can't do that, Bob.	Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.	Don't threaten me, Bob.
Don't threaten me, Bob.	Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.	His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.	I know it's not.
I know it's not.	You don't even know his name.
You don't even know his name.	Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.	What is it?
What is it?	Just get in the car, Bob.
Just get in the car, Bob.	What's his name?
What's his name?	OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.	That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
Dignan.	Anthony. Bad news.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?	Not bad.
Not bad.	Come on in. What you been up to?
Come on in. What you been up to?	Not a whole lot, Bob.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
Right. It was extremely stupid.	I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --	I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?	Man, I don't want to go into this.
You said 48 hours!	I never agreed to that.
I never agreed to that.	Bob, you're lying!
Bob, you're lying!	Bullshit.
Bullshit.	All right! Backyard! Right now!
Come on!	I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.	That's OK.
That's OK.	Look. We want you on the job.
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
I know it, man. Hang on.	Jesus Christ.
Scarecrow?	Yeah?
Everything OK?	Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?	It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.	Stand by. Bird Dog?
I couldn't hear anything.	Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
What's wrong with Applejack?	He's having a heart attack or something.
He's having a heart attack or something.	Let's go!
Is he breathing?	I think so.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?	I didn't think there was an alarm.
I didn't think there was an alarm.	Take him to the car, Bob.
The elevator broke.	Where's Applejack?
Where's Applejack?	He's stuck between two floors.
Applejack drove.	Run. Run. Let's go.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.	What's that?
What's that?	That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Do you have your own room?	We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.	Do you have your own cell?
Do you have your own cell?	No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Do they let you --	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Hold on --	Here we go.
Here we go.	Wait a second --
Wait a second --	Now!
How's that 700 bucks coming?	I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.	Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.	Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I might have mentioned it.	John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.	I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.	Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
How you doing, Bob?	Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
You keeping out of trouble?	I'm trying.
I'm trying.	This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.	He said what?
He said what?	He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.	No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
How long do you have to go?	26 weeks.
26 weeks.	And what does that cover?
And what does that cover?	Social issues. Crime prevention.
Social issues. Crime prevention.	Hand to hand combat?
Ground defense.	Did you hear that?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?	This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.	This is no good.
Is he in?	I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
What do you mean grammar?	The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
The grammar?	Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.	Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.	You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Is he good?	He's damn good.
Join the party, fellas.	We're just going over a few things.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?	Yes.
Yes.	Why?
Why?	Well, I think --
Well, I think --	No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Where did he go?	Who? Applejack?
Who? Applejack?	Why did he go that way?
Why did he go that way?	He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't...
Can't get it. It won't...	What can we do?
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
Where's that guy going?	He left his sweater.
He left his sweater.	Well, I left some money in there.
Well, I left some money in there.	Where?
Where?	In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Where is he? Where is Rob?	I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.	You got that?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
No. I just have short hair.	Is that your chiquita?
Is that your chiquita?	No, my friend knows her.
No, my friend knows her.	She Chicano, yes?
You like Chicanos?	Sure.
You a good pool player.	Got a little lucky.
Got a little lucky.	Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?	What?
What?	Fight. You know.
No. Just pool.	You Hoto?
You Hoto?	Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.	No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?	Right.
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?
Mr. Henry?	Come on in!
Come on in!	It's locked.
It's locked.	No, it's not.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.	Good to know you, John.
The world needs dreamers, son.	What?
What?	The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.	Nice to meet you.
You told me Bourne was dead.	There was a mistake.
There was a mistake.	I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.	Will it track back to us?
Will it track back to us?	No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.	And the Landy woman?
And the Landy woman?	She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...	Anything else?
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.	One last push. One.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.	Save it for Bourne.
Save it for Bourne.	What?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.	Bourne comes here? Why?
Treadstone.	Never heard of it.
Never heard of it.	That's not gonna fly.
That's not gonna fly.	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
And what are we looking for?	I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know about Treadstone.	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.	He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Let's talk about Conklin.	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?	I want to know what happened.
I want to know what happened.	What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.

Finally there were no options left.	So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...	I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.	And Bourne? Where's he now?
And Bourne? Where's he now?	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?	I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...	...this is Conklin's computer.
...this is Conklin's computer.	...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.	Do you know what his budget was?
Do you know what his budget was?	Excuse me.
Excuse me.	We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.	May I finish?
May I finish?	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?	What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
Berlin!	I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.	You don't know what you're getting into here.
You don't know what you're getting into here.	And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?	Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.	Don't you want answers?
Don't you want answers?	There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
So what's he doing? You believe him?	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...	Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
What?	They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.	Did he say anything to you?
Did he say anything to you?	No... It must have been Bourne.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?	Don't know.
Don't know.	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...	I'm sorry, Ward.
Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.	'Why' would be enough for me.
'Why' would be enough for me.	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.	Why not? It was just money.
Why not? It was just money.	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?	Had to be done.
Had to be done.	No good options left?
No good options left?	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.	No. You lost your way.
No. You lost your way.	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
Sir...	Thanks.
She say what time I should call?	The sooner the better.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.	What do you have, Danny?
What do you have, Danny?	You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.	And?
And?	There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.

If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.	It was staged?
It was staged?	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...	Jesus...
Jesus...	Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?	Keep going...
Keep going...	Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?	Lots of people...
Lots of people...	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?	Show me again...
Show me again...	Okay...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]	I speak English.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.	Okay.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.	No, I do.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.	What?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?	Yes...
Yes...	That's not what happened to your parents.
That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
Then what?	I killed them.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.	You killed them.
They loved you.  And I killed them.	How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?	I don't want you to forgive me.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
You're a liar.	You know I'm not.
You know I'm not.	YOU'RE A LIAR!
YOU'RE A LIAR!	Look at me.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!	I can't let you do that either.
I can't let you do that either.	Because you're afraid!
Because you're afraid!	No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
Is this really happening?	I'm sorry.
I emptied it.	Felt a little light.
Felt a little light.	Drop it.
Front. Use your teeth.	Sorry. Old habits.
You still should've moved.	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
So why didn't you kill me then?	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
What do you want?	Conklin.
Conklin.	He's dead.
Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Who sent you to Greece?
Who sent you to Greece?	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.	Pamela Landy?
Pamela Landy?	I don't know who that is.
I don't know who that is.	What's going on in Berlin?
What's going on in Berlin?	I don't know! Why would I lie?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...	I did.
You called it in?	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	How long? How long do I have --
-- car keys?	-- my coat -- but we should --
-- my coat -- but we should --	-- what? --
-- what? --	-- take the back -- get another car --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.	Conklin up front.
Conklin up front.	I'll get the book.
I'll get the book.	No. There's nothing new.
No. There's nothing new.	You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	-- it hasn't been two years --
-- it hasn't been two years --	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?	I worry when you get like this.
I worry when you get like this.	It's just a nightmare.
It's just a nightmare.	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.
I should be better by now.	You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.	But it ends up the same.
But it ends up the same.	One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
No... How?	The Telegraph office.
The Telegraph office.	But we were so careful.
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
But you're sure?	He was at the campground yesterday.
He was at the campground yesterday.	So...
So...	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
That's crazy.	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...	Where --
Where --	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...	We can't wait to be sure.
We can't wait to be sure.	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.	Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --	-- where's left to go? --
-- where's left to go? --	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
You drive.	What?
What?	Switch! You drive!
Switch! You drive!	-- where? -
-- where? -	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --	-- not yet --
-- not yet --	-- it's just him? --
-- it's just him? --	-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --	-- hang on --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.	What if it's not who you think it is?
What if it's not who you think it is?	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.	There must be another way!
There must be another way!	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.	Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.	There's no choice.
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
But you found another choice.	I did.
I did.	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.	It might have.
I know it's a dream.	You do?
You do?	I only dream about people who are dead.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
See that tram coming around the corner?	Yes.
Yes.	Get on it.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...	Who is Pamela Landy?
Who is Pamela Landy?	You hear me? I believed you.
You hear me? I believed you.	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Why is she trying to kill me?	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?	What is this, a game?
What is this, a game?	I want to hear it from you.
Say it.	Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.	A Russian?
A Russian?	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.	Last week? When?
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???
I killed him???	You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?	Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
Why are you here, then?	Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --	Abbott?
Abbott?	He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...	So when was I here?
So when was I here?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?	No. You never worked Berlin.
No. You never worked Berlin.	My first job.
My first job.	Your first assignment was Geneva.
Your first assignment was Geneva.	That's a lie!
That's a lie!	You never worked Berlin...
No... Jason... please...	I was here!
I was here!	...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
It's me.	Bourne?
What do you want?	I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.
I want someone I know to take me in.	Who?
Who?	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Okay, Jason, your move.	Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Where am I?	Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Oh, shit...	Careful...
Why am I alive?	Are you disappointed?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.	What's that?
What's that?	Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Don't need it. I remember everything.	Sounds like a threat.
Sounds like a threat.	You didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.	Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.	And the Germans can't match it?
Looks like he's been detained.	Who's going? Us?
Who's going? Us?	There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --	-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Alright... take it down.	What?
What?	This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.	But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
You're sure?	What? The tapes?
What? The tapes?	Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
Show me.	Here?
Here?	Now. Show now.
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --	-- shut up! -- just shut the --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?	That's where we came out.
That's where we came out.	It's a lot of money, Pam.
It's a lot of money, Pam.	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.	Still...
Still...	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Mr. Nevins?	Who's this?
Who's this?	Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
How long have you worked for the agency?	Me? Four years.
Me? Four years.	If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??	Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Yes, sir -- ma'am...	I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
What kind of problems?	Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --	Amnesia?
Amnesia?	Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Good luck.	You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?	Am I a doctor, no, but...
Am I a doctor, no, but...	Are you an expert in amnesia?
Are you an expert in amnesia?	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.	Believed what?
Believed what?	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.	So he fooled you.
So he fooled you.	If you say so.
If you say so.	Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?	You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.	You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?	You mean, did I want a date?
You mean, did I want a date?	Did you?
Did you?	These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.	Some women like Dobermans --
Some women like Dobermans --	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.	See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?
And why is that?	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Is it fresh?	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
What do you think? Is he coming in?	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.	Alright...
Let's give him half an hour.	So?
So?	Felt promising. It's a start.
Do we know what this says?	Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.	"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
Anything?	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.	Are we locked up?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.	By who?
By who?	His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.	Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.	Are we hacking or asking?
Are we hacking or asking?	Yes. In that order.
Yes. In that order.	And what about you, anything?
Someone dead from this household?	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.	I don't want to leave.
I don't want to leave.	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?	It was in Latin, sir.
It was in Latin, sir.	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
What are they doing?	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
But... what will you do?	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.	Invade?! That's impossible, it --
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.	We must sue for peace.
We must sue for peace.	Peace?!
Peace?!	We cannot defeat this --
We cannot defeat this --	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!	It is suicide.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.	So let the council swear publicly.
So let the council swear publicly.	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.	He has already agreed to come.
Young Robert, we are honored --	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Does anyone know his politics?	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?	He was a modest man.
He was a modest man.	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
Longshanks promised!	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
What news of the north?	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!	I have ordered conscriptions...
Wallace has sacked York!	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.	The Scots will fight for us?
The Scots will fight for us?	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.	But if we have not caught Wallace --
But if we have not caught Wallace --	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
What is it?!	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.	So I did! And what was so important about it?
So I did! And what was so important about it?	Scotland. He intends --
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
No, M'lord.	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Now, my flower, do you understand?	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.	You may.
Good day to you, M'Lords.	You mock us with a smile?
You mock us with a smile?	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.	Wallace's followers.
Wallace's followers.	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
The little cow is insane --	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.	When will his trial be?
When will his trial be?	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.	You fancy him.
You fancy him.	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I'll wait... back there.	Hamish, I... thank...
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.	Fourteen? --
The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Stephen ready?	Aye.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Rest, William.	I rest.
I rest.	Your rest is making me exhausted.
You know it's a trap.	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.	I don't want to be a martyr.
I don't want to be a martyr.	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.	That's just a dream, William!
That's just a dream, William!	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
They're coming!	How many?
How many?	Three, maybe more!
Three, maybe more!	Armed?
Armed?	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!	It's up to us, Hamish!
Wanna stay with me tonight?	I wanna have supper waitin'.
I wanna have supper waitin'.	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.	Aye, we'll get 'em.
Test of manhood.	You win.
You win.	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.	That depends on the man.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?	I could crush you like a roach.
You'll move	I will not.
Good to see you again.	I should'a remembered the eggs.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.	A common thief.
A common thief.	A patriot!
We must run in different directions!	We don't split up!
We don't split up!	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
Where is my son?	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!	Shall I leave, M'lord?
Shall I leave, M'lord?	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.	No. He did not.
No. He did not.	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.	Humbly, M'lord.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
I have faced him. Have you?	Let her speak.
Let her speak.	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Treason. Against whom?	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --	It matters not, he is thy king!
It matters not, he is thy king!	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!	I do not confess.
I do not confess.	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.	Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for accepting.	Thank you for inviting.
Thank you for inviting.	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.	You are. And I'll come again.
You've been here before?	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.	Did it work?
Did it work?	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I want... to marry you!	I... accept your proposal!
I... accept your proposal!	I'm not just saying it!
I'm not just saying it!	Nor I!
Nor I!	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.	You scare me.
You scare me.	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.	This night is too beautiful to have again.
This night is too beautiful to have again.	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
I've missed you.	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.	Tonight then.
Tonight then.	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Then when?	...Tonight!
I'm dreaming.	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.	And I with you. But you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.	I need you so much! I love you!
I need you so much! I love you!	Wake up, William. Wake up!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.	How do you know this?
How do you know this?	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?	...I wouldn't know.
I am the Princess of Wales.	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.	It's battle I want, not talk.
It's battle I want, not talk.	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.	That is not possible.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.	Peace is made is such ways.
Peace is made is such ways.	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.	It does me good to see you.
Why did you?	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
You have... you have a husband.	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
You will die! It will be awful!	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.	I am trying.
I am trying.	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.	I must... consult with my father.
I must... consult with my father.	And I will consult with mine.
We can't stop!	They've tricked us.
They've tricked us.	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.	Who would do such a thing?
Who would do such a thing?	Exactly.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!	I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.	What is it?
What is it?	Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?	Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...	What?
What?	When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?	Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?	Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...	Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.	Anything.
Anything.	A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.	Why? What for?
Why? What for?	It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...	And the bad news?
And the bad news?	Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.	But you must have something to go on?
But you must have something to go on?	If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.	But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?	Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.	Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.	You'd be surprised how often they are.
You'd be surprised how often they are.	Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.	How soon?...
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.	So what did you find.
No dances, just tell me.	The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
We're gonna be late again.	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?	We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Darn it!	Um... can dad come this time?
Um... can dad come this time?	You know the answer to that.
You know the answer to that.	Can't he come out for one day?
Can't he come out for one day?	We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.	But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
All the dads are gonna be there.	I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?	No.
No.	Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!	You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.	My father has a bad memory, too?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.	Great. I'll see you soon.
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?
Honey. What were you doing with that?	I... I don't remember.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?	Okay.
I don't know... I don't remember.	Something must've happened! What set him off?
Something must've happened! What set him off?	I... I blacked out.
I... I blacked out.	Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Please, mom. People will talk.	I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.	Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.	Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Why do you ask?	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.	When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...	Sure...
Sure...	And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...	What? What could he do?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.	How long will I be in here?
How long will I be in here?	I don't know. These things take time.
I don't know. These things take time.	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I found these. The others are still in storage.	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!	Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?	Cute, Evan.
What does that mean for Evan?	He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
There must be a way to fix this.	Fix?
Fix?	I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
You're. Acting. Like your father.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
How. Did you. Know that?	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.	Can you protect me?
Can you protect me?	Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
"You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?"""	Straight up.
Straight up.	Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.	Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.	I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.	You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.	Weirder than this?
Weirder than this?	Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
What did you see? What did it look like?	Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!	So you believe me?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.	You know my father?
Dad lives here?	Not in this wing, actually. No.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?	Yes.
Yes.	Where are you now?
Where are you now?	I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.	Are you hurting her?
Are you hurting her?	No, protecting her.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?	I see a car.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.	I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.	The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.	It's coming... argh! I can't!
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.	Are you sure? Not even with my father?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.	Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.	Where are my goddamn books?
Where are my goddamn books?	Books?
Books?	My journals! Where are they?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...	But I... I need those books.
But I... I need those books.	You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.	Photos?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	I thought you were a December baby.
I thought you were a December baby.	This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.	Like Ozzy.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.	That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
You really think he wanted to kill you?	All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --	What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?	Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Are you stupid or what?	What?
What?	Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?	Huh?
Huh?	Fuck off, frat boy.
Get out. Both of you.	Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.	So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Oh God... what did we do?	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.	You really don't remember anything that happened?
Ouch.	I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.	Damn. Your dad did this?
I deserve a lot worse.	What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.	Duck, here they come.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.	Hi, Lenny.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?	Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...	No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.	I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.
I've stopped a hundred times.	So how's Tommy?
So how's Tommy?	They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.	Not if you remember my dad.
Not if you remember my dad.	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?	She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.	Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?	Of course.
Of course.	Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.	Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.	When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?	What do you want to know, Evan?
What do you want to know, Evan?	It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?	It was a long time ago.
It was a long time ago.	I know, but...
I know, but...	Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?	No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.	Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.	Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Where... where are my clothes?	Those are your clothes, silly.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?	Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?	I dunno.  Just being weird.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?	So it didn't feel... weird?
So it didn't feel... weird?	Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?	As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
Why are you doing all this for me?	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.	Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.	Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.	Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.	It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Are you okay?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?	Like how?
Like how?	I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.	I walk differently?
I walk differently?	I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...	I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	What?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!	He's a fucking maniac!
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --	Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.	Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.	I get it. You can drop it now.
I get it. You can drop it now.	Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.	Ha! Where's that?
Ha! Where's that?	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
What's happened to you?	"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."
"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."	I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.	Why's that?
Why's that?	Because you're... different.
Because you're... different.	Different? How?
Different? How?	Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.	Yeah?
Yeah?	On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.	Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.	I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.	I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.	Oh? There's proof now?
Oh? There's proof now?	Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?	Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
Know what?	That I didn't leave you there to rot.
There's one major hole in your story.	Which is?
Which is?	There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Sure you don't want your wallet?	Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.	Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.	Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Where are we going?	We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.	Stop! Take me back!
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.	He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Is something the matter?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
"Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.	I was?
I was?	That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.	I don't get it.
I don't get it.	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.	I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?	It's crossed my mind from time to time.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.	And...?
And...?	Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.	Then you think it might have worked out?
Then you think it might have worked out?	Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?	Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.	Kayleigh? What happened?
What time is it?	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.	Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?	It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.	Who -- who are you?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?	...yes.
...yes.	Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.	And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?	Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.	But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.	"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."
"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."	Who's to say you can't make things better?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.	Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?	We'll find out soon enough.
We'll find out soon enough.	Me neither.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!	Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.	Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...	I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?	Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?	Hey, I got no choice.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.	Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...	I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.	I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?	And you are...?
And you are...?	Evan Treborn.
Evan Treborn.	The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
So what's the point?	Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Smells like sex in here.	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.	You're kidding. He's so... big.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.	Wow... read something.
"Freeze! No ""worm-boy"". No ""Mr. Worm,"" and no ""Worm-Master-General!"" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"	Deal. Now read me something.
Come on, go on...	It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
It didn't feel like a dream.	Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Can... can... Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
I couldn't cut the rope.	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?	Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!	Y... yes. I guess I did.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.	Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Are you sure you even packed it?	My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.	Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.	What?
What?	Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.	Destroy it?
Destroy it?	If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?	Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!	What happened?? Where are we?!
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!	"Get this ""us"" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.	No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.	"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
Listen to me good, Evan...	I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.	Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Lung cancer?	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Just get out, didja?	Huh?
Huh?	Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.	I come from a big family.
I come from a big family.	Meant no offense.
Meant no offense.	None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?	Sorry. Never heard of her.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.	I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --	Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!	I thought I was the bad guy!
I thought I was the bad guy!	You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?	Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.	Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?	I'm sorry.
Lenny? Come on!	Oh my God oh my God...
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.	You're such a retard!
Here you go, buddy.	What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.	The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.	Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Monsieur Rick?	Yes?
Yes?	Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
How did you get in here? You're under age.	I came with Captain Renault.
I came with Captain Renault.	I should have known.
I should have known.	My husband is with me, too.
My husband is with me, too.	He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?	No.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.	No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?	He did. Captain Renault did.
He did. Captain Renault did.	I thought so. Where's your husband?
I thought so. Where's your husband?	At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
How long have you been married?	Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.	So you decided to go to America.
So you decided to go to America.	Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.	Yes, I'll bet.
Yes, I'll bet.	He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.	Does he know that?
Does he know that?	Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.	And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?	Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, Monsieur.	And you want to know --
And you want to know --	-- Will he keep his word?
-- Will he keep his word?	He always has.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?	You want my advice?
You want my advice?	Oh, yes, please.
Oh, yes, please.	Go back to Bulgaria.
Go back to Bulgaria.	Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.	Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.	Well?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.	Thank you, but I hardly think --
Thank you, but I hardly think --	-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Good.	What is your name?
What is your name?	Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?	I'm sorry. It is.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?	Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, Monsieur.	A champagne cocktail, please.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.	In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.	We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.	As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
I see.	But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?	No thanks, Carl.
No thanks, Carl.	Monsieur Rick!
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.	How long can I afford to stay closed?
How long can I afford to stay closed?	Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.	Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.	Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?	I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --	-- Don't tell me where you're going.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.	I won't.
I won't.	Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.	Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come.	I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.	But Sacha always puts out that light --
But Sacha always puts out that light --	-- Tonight he forgot.
-- Tonight he forgot.	Yes, I come, I will do it.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.	Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.	Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.	I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --	-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.	I'm awfully sorry.
Here you are.	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.	That's all right.
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.
Er, good luck, yes.	I'd better be going.
I'd better be going.	Er, my check, please.
Er, my check, please.	I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, Rick.	Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?	Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.	It's not for sale.
It's not for sale.	You haven't heard my offer.
You haven't heard my offer.	It's not for sale at any price.
It's not for sale at any price.	What do you want for Sam?
What do you want for Sam?	I don't buy or sell human beings.
I don't buy or sell human beings.	That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.	Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.	Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.	Suppose we do.
Suppose we do.	My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.	No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.	I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.	Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.	You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.	Practically no one.
Practically no one.	If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.	So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.	I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.	And the carrying charges?
And the carrying charges?	Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.	I'll tell him when he comes in.
I'll tell him when he comes in.	Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.	Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.	Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?	It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.	Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.	Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.	And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.	Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.	Well, so long.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.	I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.	As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.	Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --	-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.	Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?	Yes, something.
Yes, something.	Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Do you know where they are?	Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Rick?	He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.	Thank you very much. Good day.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.	Good day.
And Mademoiselle?	You needn't be concerned about me.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.	This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.	That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.	Occupied France?
Occupied France?	Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.	What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.	There are only two other alternatives for him.
There are only two other alternatives for him.	What are they?
What are they?	It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.	And the other alternative?
And the other alternative?	My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""	How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.	Not an easy day to forget.
Not an easy day to forget.	No.
No.	I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.	Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.	I will.
I will.	"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."
"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."	He hasn't played it in a long time.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?	"We said ""no questions."""
"We said ""no questions."""	Here's looking at you, kid.
A franc for your thoughts.	In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.	I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.	And I was wondering.
And I was wondering.	Yes?
Yes?	Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.	Why there is no other man in my life?
Why there is no other man in my life?	Uh huh.
Uh huh.	That's easy. There was. He's dead.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.	"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""	Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.	I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
My German's a little rusty.	It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.	Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?	Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?	Looking for a job.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?	Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Strange. I know so very little about you.	I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.	Yes, of course, we --
Yes, of course, we --	-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.	No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?	All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
That's too far ahead to plan.	Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?	Oh, darling!
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?	I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Especially tonight.
Please.	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.	I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.	"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""
"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""	Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.	Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?	I didn't count the days.
I didn't count the days.	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?
Has it got a wow finish?	I don't know the finish yet.
I don't know the finish yet.	Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.	It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.

And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.	"Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?"
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.	It doesn't matter.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?	Yes.
Yes.	Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.	I don't think I will, Rick.
I don't think I will, Rick.	Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.	Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.

If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	You can believe that if you want to.
You can believe that if you want to.	Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.	No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
How did you get in?	The stairs from the street.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?	Richard, I had to see you.
Richard, I had to see you.	"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."	Please.
Please.	Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.	I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.	Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --	-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.	Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --	-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.	What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.	I don't have to. I've got them right here.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.	Put them on the table.
Put them on the table.	No.
No.	For the last time, put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.	If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
And then?	"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."

I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.	When did you first find out he was alive?
When did you first find out he was alive?	Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.

But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?	Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.	And Laszlo?
And Laszlo?	Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.	All except one. He won't have you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	I wish I didn't love you so much.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?	No, not yet.
No, not yet.	But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?	Everything is quite all right.
Everything is quite all right.	Oh, Rick!
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.
Because you're getting on that plane.	I don't understand. What about you?
I don't understand. What about you?	I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --	-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.	But Richard, no, I, I --
But Richard, no, I, I --	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.	No.
No.	Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.	But what about us?
But what about us?	We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.	And I said I would never leave you.
And I said I would never leave you.	And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Yes.	She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Hello, Sam.	Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.	Some of the old songs, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.	Yes, ma'am.
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.	Does he always leave so early?
Does he always leave so early?	Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.	You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.	Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.	I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.	"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.	If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I must find out what Berger knows.	Be careful.
Be careful.	I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.	No, Victor, no.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.	But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?	Yes, I would.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.	I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.	To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?	Apparently he has the letters.
Apparently he has the letters.	Yes?
Yes?	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Did he give any reason?	He suggested I ask you.
He suggested I ask you.	Ask me?
Ask me?	"Yes. He said, ""Ask your wife."" I don't know why he said that."
Ilsa, I --	-- Yes?
-- Yes?	When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, Victor, I was.	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?	No, Victor, there isn't.
No, Victor, there isn't.	I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?	Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.	Sam?
Sam?	Yes.
Yes.	He came from Paris with Rick.
He came from Paris with Rick.	Rick? Who's he?
Rick? Who's he?	Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --	-- Is what?
-- Is what?	Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Hello, Rick.	Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Well then, perhaps you also ---	-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.	I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?	How do you do?
How do you do?	One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.	Won't you join us for a drink?
And I congratulate you.	What for?
What for?	Your work.
Your work.	Thank you. I try.
Thank you. I try.	We all try. You succeed.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.	Not at all.
We'll come again.	Any time.
Good morning.	Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.	I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?	Go ahead.
Go ahead.	Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.	My office.
My office.	Right.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.	I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.	My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.	What of it?
What of it?	Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?	Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?	I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.	I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.	My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.	There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.	There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.	I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?	I said, ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.	My wife?
Well, this might come in handy.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Had a close one, eh?
Had a close one, eh?	Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?	We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.	What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.	Yes, I get the point.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.	You seem to know all about my destiny.
You seem to know all about my destiny.	I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

You love her that much?	Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.	Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.	Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.	But we made a deal.
But we made a deal.	Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?	No. It's all arranged.
No. It's all arranged.	Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Everything in order?	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.	Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.	I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.	Yes.
Yes.	But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I understand.	Here it is.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?	Yes.
Yes.	I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.	Yes. What is it you want?
Yes. What is it you want?	Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.	Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?	I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
No, Captain, please.	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.	Very well.
My bill.	No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!	This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.	Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.	So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.	We'll be there.
We'll be there.	Goodnight.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?	I slept very well.
I slept very well.	That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.	May we proceed with the business?
May we proceed with the business?	With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?	Thank you.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.	I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --	-- Thank you.
-- Thank you.	By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.	Yes.
Yes.	I believe you have a message for him?
I believe you have a message for him?	Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.	Are you quite finished with us?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.	You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.	I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.	This is hardly the time or the place.
This is hardly the time or the place.	Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.	Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.	Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.	Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Is that all you wish to tell us?	Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.	And that is?
And that is?	You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.	Even in Berlin.
Even in Berlin.	Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
You will give us the names?	"If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now."
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.	Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.	You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
For the time being.	Good day.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.	Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.	Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.	What else, my dear Major?
What else, my dear Major?	By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?	Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.	I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.	Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.	May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.	Thank you.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.	I expected no less, Captain.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.	How do you do, Mr. Rick?
"You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."	Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.	Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Ho, diplomatist!	How about New York?
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.	You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.	I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.	Perhaps.
Mademoiselle.	Mademoiselle.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.	You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.	"But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918."
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.	It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.	My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?	I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.	And if it should change?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.	A leader, like Laszlo?
A leader, like Laszlo?	Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.	I see what you mean.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.	But everybody's having such a good time.
But everybody's having such a good time.	Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.	But I have no excuse to close it.
But I have no excuse to close it.	Find one.
What is the meaning of that phone call?	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?	Ask Monsieur Rick.
Hello, Louis.	How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?	When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?	Why? What's in Lisbon?
Why? What's in Lisbon?	The clipper to America.
It was a combination of all three.	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?	My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.	I was misinformed.
I was misinformed.	Huh!
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.	What, again?
What, again?	This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.	I stick my neck out for nobody.
I stick my neck out for nobody.	A wise foreign policy.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.	Our entertainment is enough.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.	Perhaps not.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.	Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? Have a brandy?	Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.	I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.	That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.	Yeah? What's his name?
Yeah? What's his name?	Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo.	Victor Laszlo?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.	Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.	It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.	It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.	Manages what?
Manages what?	His escape.
His escape.	Oh, but I just told you. --
Oh, but I just told you. --	-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.	This is the end of the chase.
This is the end of the chase.	Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Is that a serious offer?	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.	Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.	Okay.
Okay.	Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.	Why two?
Why two?	He is traveling with a lady.
He is traveling with a lady.	He'll take one.
He'll take one.	I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.	Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.	It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.	Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?	Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.	And got well paid for it on both occasions.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.	The winning side would have paid you much better.
The winning side would have paid you much better.	Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.	I have my orders.
I have my orders.	Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.
Oh, how do you do?	And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.	I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --	-- Hello, Ilsa.
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
Oh, it's my party.	Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.	That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?	Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?	Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.	Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.	Huh?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.	Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.	Yeah? Why?
Yeah? Why?	Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
Put it down as a gesture to love.	Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
How can you close me up? On what grounds?	I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.	Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --	-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?	Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.	Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.	Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.	You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.	Huh?
Huh?	And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.	What friend?
What friend?	Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.	You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?	It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.	Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.	There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.	Well, she isn't just any woman.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?	I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.	Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.	Oh, thanks.
Oh, thanks.	Go ahead, Ricky.
You're late.	I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.	I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.	Oh, he won't be followed here.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.	Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.	Is everything ready?
I have the letters right here.	Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?	Sam's piano.
Sam's piano.	Serves me right for not being musical.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.	Have you taken leave of your senses?
Have you taken leave of your senses?	I have. Sit down over there.
I have. Sit down over there.	Put that gun down.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?	I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.	Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.	Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.	That is my least vulnerable spot.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.	You think of everything, don't you?
You think of everything, don't you?	And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.	Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.	Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.	I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.	As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.	Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.	I think perhaps you're right.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.	My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.	And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.	Our expenses?
Our expenses?	Uh huh.
Uh huh.	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.	Will I see you tonight?
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
Give me another.	Sacha, she's had enough.
Sacha, she's had enough.	Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --	-- Sacha, call a cab.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
What is your nationality?	I'm a drunkard.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.	There seems to be no secret about that.
There seems to be no secret about that.	Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?	It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.	Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?	I haven't the slightest idea.
Are my eyes really brown?	You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.	My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.	In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?	Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.	Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.	Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I would advise you not to interfere.	I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Hello?	Put that phone down!
Put that phone down!	Get me the Radio Tower!
Get me the Radio Tower!	Put it down!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.	Hello Ugarte.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.	Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?	Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --	-- You thought what?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?	They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.	You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?	No.
No.	I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?	If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.	But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.	For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.	But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?	I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.	Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.	Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?	Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.	For how long?
For how long?	Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.	I don't want them here overnight.
I don't want them here overnight.	Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.	Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.	I like it fine here.
I like it fine here.	He'll double what I pay you.
He'll double what I pay you.	Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.	Sorry.
Boss!	Yeah?
Yeah?	Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?	Not right now.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?	No.
No.	You ever going to bed?
You ever going to bed?	No.
No.	Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.	Good. Then have a drink.
Good. Then have a drink.	No. Not me, boss.
No. Not me, boss.	Then don't have a drink.
Then don't have a drink.	Boss, let's get out of here.
Boss, let's get out of here.	No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.	Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.	She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.	We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.	Shut up and go home, will you?
Shut up and go home, will you?	No, sir. I'm staying right here.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?	Yeah, boss?
Yeah, boss?	Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?	Uh, my watch stopped.
Uh, my watch stopped.	I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.
Just a little something of my own.	Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.	No, I don't.
No, I don't.	You played it for her and you can play it for me.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.	Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.	If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!	Yes, boss.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?	You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.	The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --	Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.	So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
It's bad.	Worse than Warsaw.
Worse than Warsaw.	Nobody remembers that.
Nobody remembers that.	The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!	Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.	With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.
Feels so good to lie here.	Get up, damn you.
Can't.  Need water.	You've had today's water.
You've had today's water.	Thirsty.
Thirsty.	Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.	No water, no work.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.	Do too much, I'll die.
Do too much, I'll die.	Do too little you'll die.
Do too little you'll die.	Going to die anyway.
No more water, you said.	Take it.
Take it.	No.
No.	Take it, damn it.
Take it, damn it.	No.
No.	Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
If they can't see you, what's the point?	Survive today, that's the point.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.	You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.	Moon's too bright.
You're putting off the inevitable.	I'm putting it off.
Get water!	Fix raft first.
Fix raft first.	Water water water --
You're beautiful.  Marry me.	You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
What are you doing?	Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.	You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.	Why do they have to die for me?
Why do they have to die for me?	They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.	No!
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.	You quitter you quitter you quitter.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.	The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.	But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.	Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.	If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.	Die tomorrow or die today.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...	Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.	Yeah, sure, what?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.	Thank you for fucking up my life.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.	I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.	They're on autopilot.
They're on autopilot.	They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.	Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I float.  You sink.  End of story.	I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.	It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.	Shut up.
What's so damn funny?	You are.
Jesus.	Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
It's real.	Nothing out there but ocean.
Nothing out there but ocean.	Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.	It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.	Then we've just got shit.
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.	There was an unavoidable delay.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.	No.
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.
As much as anybody.	Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.	Okay.  Sure.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.	Possible.  So you did those wings?
Possible.  So you did those wings?	Yeah.  A long time ago.
Yeah.  A long time ago.	They're harder to do than they look.
They're harder to do than they look.	Oh?  You've tried?
Oh?  You've tried?	Well, I do a little drawing --
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.	He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.	Well, not really, I --
Well, not really, I --	You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
To tell you the truth -- you did.	Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?	No.  that was the last one.
No.  that was the last one.	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Keep painting.  Promise me.	Sure.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?	I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
What brings you out to the sticks?	Had a package to deliver.
Had a package to deliver.	You?  Personally?
You?  Personally?	I had it on the island with me.
I had it on the island with me.	Must be a story there.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
I've got lots of time.	So do I.
Sonofabitch!	Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?	You smell like formaldehyde.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.	Let's take a look.
How was Russia?	Cold.
Cold.	Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?	I thought I did.
Got to follow the paper path here.	Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Chuck.	What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?	Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Merry Christmas eve.	Not if you work for FedEx.
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
You don't seem too happy about it.	Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.	Let me guess, Russia came up?
Hey, look at you.	I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.
He's your cute thing.	I can't even keep fish alive.
I can't even keep fish alive.	A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.	And for you --
You know, for when you travel.	For when I travel?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.	A ring.  I wanted a ring.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.	You did?
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.	You can't go now.
You can't go now.	I have to.
I have to.	You want to.
This isn't working out.	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.	"""We're"" not over-reacting."
"""We're"" not over-reacting."	Could you watch Jango?
Could you watch Jango?	No.
No.	I can't take him to work.
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.	There isn't any us.
There isn't any us.	Yes there is.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.	No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --	I burned the Christmas tree.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.	What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.	Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.	Don't even start.
Get back?  From where?	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?	Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...	Hey...hey...it's okay!
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
I got married.	I thought you might have.
I thought you might have.	I would never --
I would never --	I know.
I know.	If I'd known you were alive --
If I'd known you were alive --	I would have done the same thing.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.	You have any children?
Her name's Hannah.	Is that Jango?
Is that Jango?	No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
What's that?	That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.	Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
What's that, written on the sail?	My epitaph.
There was a coffin?	Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.	What was inside?
What was inside?	Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.	That about sums it up.
That about sums it up.	Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.	The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.	Yeah?
Yeah?	The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.	Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Come on.  Try.	Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.	So simple to say, so hard to do.
So simple to say, so hard to do.	Not when you have no choice.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.	I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
This is so unfair.	That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You okay?	Great.  Really.
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.	It means a lot...that you came.
It means a lot...that you came.	I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
I love you, Chuck.	You too.
You too.	I'm so glad you're alive.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.	And how was your Christmas?
And how was your Christmas?	Terrific.  Yours?
When's the next Jumbo?	The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.	Anything else?
Anything else?	There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?	Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?	Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.	All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.	Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.	Which I didn't have.
Which I didn't have.	And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
I am one lucky guy.	Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.	But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
I most definitely say I am.	Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Yes, yes he did.	You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?	Not to mention on me.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.	Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Need some help?	You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?	No.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.	Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.	Sure.
You're Chuck Noland.	Yeah.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.	Let's eat.
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
But chickens?	Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.	True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Really?	Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.	Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
What happened to your pants?	Mom, meet Jango.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?	That new roof, that's your doing.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.	Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...	Don't you even think about it.
Don't you even think about it.	The place is falling apart.
The place is falling apart.	I'm doing fine.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.	There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
When'd you start working here?	Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --	I wanted to come here.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?	This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.	The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Trying.	Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.	What about the sender?
What about the sender?	Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.	Can you find her?
Can you find her?	You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Kamal is not here.	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?	It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.	What's going on down there?
What's going on down there?	Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?	Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
How'd it go?	Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.	But I might not have.
But I might not have.	Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...	I'm touched.

And never take.	Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.	Forget it.
Forget it.	You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.

Hello.	This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
How about we go somewhere else?	Want to see my raft?
This stinks really bad.	You should have smelled me.
Cool ropes.	I braided them.
I braided them.	Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.	Time I had lots of.
You were how long on this?	Forty-three days.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.	I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
To Wilson.	To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!	Hallelujah.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...	What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.	To life.

That's all there is.	Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.	Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Take your time.	What?
What?	That's what it's about.
That's what it's about.	Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.	Deep, real deep.
What, then?	Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.	You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.	I need to do it.
I need to do it.	Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Thanks.  For everything.	No sweat.
Permission to come aboard, sir.	Permission granted.
Permission granted.	May I ask, where are you bound?
May I ask, where are you bound?	San Francisco.  And you?
San Francisco.  And you?	As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.

Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!	Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...	You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?	Dr. Homer Wells.

But you've studied with the old man for *years*!	I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm *not* a doctor!	I'm sorry, Homer.
I mean your parents.	I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.	Why not?
Why not?	Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.	Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.	What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?	Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.	You cook very well!
You cook very well!	And that I can drive a truck!
And that I can drive a truck!	Better than I can!
Better than I can!	Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.	I know.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.	I doubt it. She's just an...
What's she so emotional about?	I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
What'd she die of?	She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
What are you going to tell the little ones?	I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.	Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?

They'll believe it because they want to believe it.	Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?	If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
It's time somebody ate *them*.	I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!	Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.	He mentions Homer, too, you know.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.	"Wally said to say, ""Hello."""
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?	Daddy, *please*...
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.	Good night, Daddy.
So, Mrs...	Candy. Candy Kendall.
How many months are you?	Two.
Is your family in the apple business, too?	No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.	I've never seen a lobster.
I've never seen a lobster.	Really?
Really?	I've never seen the ocean, either.
I know.	He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!	Where's Mandalay?
Where's Mandalay?	Burma!
Burma!	Oh...
Oh...	I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!	I understand.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.	It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.	Sure... I'll see you around.
So. Not bored yet?	I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?	When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.	Okay...
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
A movie *outside*?	Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.	People watched the movies in their cars?
People watched the movies in their cars?	When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?	Yes! I've only seen one, though.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"""King Kong"". It's really good."
But you looked as if you liked it.	"I *did* like it. All I said was, ""It's not 'King Kong'."""
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...	She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
And what did she die of, exactly?	She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.	Oh, sure!
What's the *medical* explanation?	"Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about ""King Kong""?! Is that medically possible?"
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.	You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?	Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?	It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.	At least you were never lonely.
At least you were never lonely.	I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
You don't miss it?	I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.	But you had so much *responsibility*.
But you had so much *responsibility*.	I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.	Just a little privacy.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?	The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
How could you not *care* about the movie?	You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.	That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.	Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?	Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I *know* this was right.	Right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?	It will be okay.
It will be okay.	*What* will be okay?
*What* will be okay?	We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?	"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"
"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"	I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.	Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.	No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.	Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.	It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...	I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...	Well, we have to help her!
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.	You don't understand! It's her father...
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?
Mr. Rose *knows*?	He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?	We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.	Nothing.
Nothing.	Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?	No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.	I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.	No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.	*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!	If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...	I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Stop it! Just cut it out!	You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!	For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
I know, I'm sorry.	He's *paralyzed*!
He's *paralyzed*!	He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.	What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't make me say it again.	No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?	Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.	"""...did."" Well, okay."
"""...did."" Well, okay."	Please don't...
Please don't...	And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...	You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.	Sure. Thanks.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...	I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.	No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.	No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
How is that Wally doing?	Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Hi...	Hi...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.	I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.	Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.	Yes, I *have*!
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...	I can't go nowhere.
I can't go nowhere.	Why?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?	No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
So many children. Are they all orphans?	Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I'm okay--I can walk.	I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.	No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
Wally thinks apples are boring.	I never said they were boring.
I never said they were boring.	"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""
"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""	Well, they aren't.
There! You said it was boring.	Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, Wally.	I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.	I know what you've been doing.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!	He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
They wanted a girl.	Nobody ever wants me!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.	Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!	That's true.
That's true.	Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?	Nobody special enough, Curly.
Nobody special enough, Curly.	You mean somebody asked?
You mean somebody asked?	Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.	How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
That's a heavy sedation.	You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!	He's leaving...

You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.	Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?	But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!	He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.	I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!

Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.	Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
Is *your* father dead?	Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.	*Liver* killed him?
*Liver* killed him?	*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.	But did you know him?
But did you know him?	Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.	Did you know your mother better?
Did you know your mother better?	She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.	What's a nanny do?
What's a nanny do?	She looks after other people's children.
She looks after other people's children.	Did you grow up around here?
Did you grow up around here?	No. She was an immigrant.
No. She was an immigrant.	What's an immigrant?
What's an immigrant?	Someone not from Maine.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?	Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.	That's why Kong loves her!
"""I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."""	His father's dead, right?
Uh... it's the end of October.	Is that soon?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.	Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
I don't remember.	It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.	Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.	No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.	I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.	It's okay--I don't mind.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--	No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.	Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
What kind of plane are you flying?	A B-24 Liberator.
A B-24 Liberator.	Liberator...
Liberator...	Have you enlisted?
Have you enlisted?	They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.	Really! Is it serious?
Really! Is it serious?	No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?	Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.	You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?	No, I'm not. I need a job.
No, I'm not. I need a job.	The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.	I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!	It's all very normal.
"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma..."	*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
At what altitude?	I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!	Actually, I volunteered.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.	Oh, I would love that, Wally.
They're migrants.	Migrants?
Migrants?	Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
It's almost like flying.	What about the trees?
What about the trees?	The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?	Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.	You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.	Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.	I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
So. What should I do now?	Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?	Right.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.	Okay...
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?	I guess so...
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...	Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...	What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.	Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.	This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.	You still doin' it too fast!
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!	Is it true?
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.	You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?	Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.	You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?	Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
But she's your *daughter*...	And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...	You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
What business is you in, Homer?	Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
What's that? What's it called?	One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.	There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.	When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.	Where'd she get you?
Where'd she get you?	She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.	That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?	Right?
First pregnancy?	Yes, for both.
Yes, for both.	I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.	All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.	You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?	One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.	What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
There was no visible wound?	No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!	It looks like scurvy.
It looks like scurvy.	Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
It's obviously an aborticide.	Obviously.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!	I don't know it.
I don't know it.	If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.	In other words, scurvy.
In other words, scurvy.	"Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself ""not a doctor""!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble."
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.	I haven't read that.
I haven't read that.	I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.	But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?	"When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections ""underdeveloped."" Would you?"
Where's the name sheet?	Nobody's named this one yet.
Nobody's named this one yet.	It's my turn!
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.	Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?	I don't think so.
I don't think so.	You do it then.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.	"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.	We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?	It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?	How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.	I'm happy I amuse you.
I'm happy I amuse you.	Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.	Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!	Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.	I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.	In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.	Of course.
Of course.	Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!	You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...	I don't need your gratitude.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I am not a doctor.	You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.	Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.	There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.	I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Uh... sure.	Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?	Right.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.	How long's this been going on, Muddy?
How long's this been going on, Muddy?	Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""	We heard that one already, Homer.
We heard that one already, Homer.	"""Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."""
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.	Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Rose Rose?	Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
What's that?	It's just my heart.
It's just my heart.	What you got a picture of your heart for?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.	So what?
So what?	Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.	No trouble.
I'm not in trouble.	Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Give men that. I know how to do it.	Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?	Almost.
You okay, Rose?	I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...	I don't like watching anyone be sick.
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?
Not yet. What do you know about it?	I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?	Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.	But you don't look very happy.
But you don't look very happy.	*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.	Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.	You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!	Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
That's *it*?	That's it.
That's it.	It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Who cares?	Now, now. He's a good boy.
Now, now. He's a good boy.	Shit. We don't know what he is.
Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.	You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.	Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!	It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.	You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!	What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Do you know him?	*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.	Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!	You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?	Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!	Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.	Why was he missing for twenty days?
Why was he missing for twenty days?	Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Then it's malaria?	It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.	When will he be home, Major?
When will he be home, Major?	Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told me I was too old to serve.	They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?	Mind your own business, Peaches.
Mind your own business, Peaches.	Sorry, Homer...
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!	We see you next harvest.
Don't this place look like home?	It look nicer then home!
It look nicer then home!	What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.	They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!	Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!	Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.	What view?
*What* view?	Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.	Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.	Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.	I told him that you all is sick.
I told him that you all is sick.	Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?	*You* taught her, I suppose...
*You* taught her, I suppose...	That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.	That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.	You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...	What's lucky about that?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!	Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.	Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!	You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.	You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Where do you think you're going?	You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!	I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.	That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!	She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.	The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...	Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
Rose Rose has runned away!	She took off in the night!
She took off in the night!	She took off on the bicycle, man.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?	He ain't never been outta Maine!
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.	Tough day?
Tough day?	Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?	Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.	Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
So, what do you do?	It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.	Silicon Valley?
Silicon Valley?	That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
Can --	On me. For the seat. Cheers.
"So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say ""no"" without ever using the word."	Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.	No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.	Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.	You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.	I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?	What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.	Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.	Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --	A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.	That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.	They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.	Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.	We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22	I don't follow.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?	Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.	Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.

Sort of like a letter of intent.	Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.	And you have this letter of intent?
And you have this letter of intent?	Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
We had to finalize the deal.	Everything looks in order.
Everything looks in order.	This has to happen fast.
This has to happen fast.	I know. It won't go unnoticed.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.	There'll be red flags.
What's this?	You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Let's just slow down for a second...	You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.	No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.	The standard ten.
The standard ten.	Ten percent. Of how much?
Ten percent. Of how much?	Two million.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.	Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?	Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.	Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.	What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?	I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.	It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
And I think it's because of this redhead...	Know who I am, Jake?
Know who I am, Jake?	The Anti-Christ?
The Anti-Christ?	No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.	Gee... What makes you say that?
Gee... What makes you say that?	Your life flashing before your eyes?
Your life flashing before your eyes?	Just the last three weeks.
Just the last three weeks.	That's not a bad place to start.
Grifters...	We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.	It's all about the money, isn't it?
It's all about the money, isn't it?	Isn't it always?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.	And these cops? What do they get?
Keeping the Fix happy.	You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.	Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.	So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.	In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
So how'd you get caught?	Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
I can see why you liked her.	That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
But there were other factors.	Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.	Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Nice.	We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?	Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.

You're a superstitious fucker.	Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.	Like what?
Like what?	Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
She had you tempting fate.	My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?	You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...	I was doing it for them.
I was doing it for them.	BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.	It's not true.
It's not true.	Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
After you cut her loose.	She walked.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?	Today? Started off great...
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?	Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?	It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.	Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.	Guess so.
Guess so.	So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?	Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.

So we go to the bar.
So we go to the bar.	I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.	We'll take care of it.
We'll take care of it.	And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Who's that?	"The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says ""boo."""

Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.	Mob?
Mob?	Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.	So what? We hide, right?
So what? We hide, right?	What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.

You're pissed we didn't get credit?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?	No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.	We sure Big Al threw him to us?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?	Come on...
Whoa. What?	We're going to give him the money back?
Fuck that. We're going too.	Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.	People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
The red hair... It's bad luck.	It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.	I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Masters of our own destiny.	So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Jake...	It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
Moonan. Here. Shit...	So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!	Jake, I mean, come on --
Shit.	I told you, use less powder.
I told you, use less powder.	But you won't get that splatter effect.
What? I can feel you looking at me.	That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.	Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.	I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
It can buy you a new and better you.	"I just don't know if this says, ""me"". What's the fabric?"
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.	Well, this is just fucking great...
Well, this is just fucking great...	"It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the ""Send?"" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin."
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
And what about Big Al?	Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
When?	Tonight. Just me.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?	Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
How much we going after?	Two million.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.	We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.	How's that? He works for Gillette.
How's that? He works for Gillette.	We pay better.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.	"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --	Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She up for this?	She's up for it.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.	"So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says ""The code's fine, the program's for shit"" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!"
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.	You sure?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.	And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
Eight A.M. flight.	Calls?
Calls?	We'll use the Euc.
Jake --	What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
So that's it...	That's it.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...	I'd like this cashed, please.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?	What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.	Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.	Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?	I have a good crew.
I have a good crew.	Minus one.
Minus one.	You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.

I guess it lacks a certain style.	Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.	You can't cheat an honest man.
You can't cheat an honest man.	You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...	I apologize for the inconvenience.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.	I can't do that.
I can't do that.	Why not?
Why not?	Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.	Let me repeat -- Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?	Because you killed one of my crew.
Because you killed one of my crew.	Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...	I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.	Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.	No. Just confidence.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.	We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Why?	You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
How much?	I think two million.
I think two million.	What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.	I need you to stake me.
I need you to stake me.	Stake you?
Stake you?	I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?	Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.	"Hey Skippy? Do I have the word ""chump"" tattooed on my forehead?"
Listen, Scooter --	No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
Excuse me?	I said take off your fucking shirt.
Look at you, you skinny prick.	You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
No thanks. I'm good.	Come here!
Come on. Harder.	I think I just broke my hand.
I think I just broke my hand.	Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.	Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.	All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.	Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?	Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.	Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?	Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.	Ring it for him, Sobo.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.	Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.	Wouldn't dream of it.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.	Something stupid.
Something stupid.	Good boy.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?	Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Sorry, I --	Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.	Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?	Great. Thank you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?	My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Attractive girl.	Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?	Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?	Very much so.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?	Sure.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.	Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!	I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --	Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Oh Jesus!	LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What -- What do we do?	Help me.
What about... The money?	What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.	Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?	Says who?
Says who?	You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.	Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.	Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.	Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.	I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.
You get an equal cut.	What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?	Just play a part. A little acting.
What about Customs?	I'll worry about Customs.
I'll worry about Customs.	Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.	Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Mr. King, I think --	Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.	It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
You need to get a haircut.	What?
What?	And some new clothes.
And some new clothes.	Why?
Why?	We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.	You're just going to have to trust me.
You're just going to have to trust me.	I don't trust anyone.
I don't trust anyone.	Then show me how.
Uh... Everything okay?	Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
He's gone.	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	I gotta go get a haircut.
I gotta go get a haircut.	Uh-huh.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.	Lighten up.
Lighten up.	But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
You told me to change my hair!	What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!	Did I miss something?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...	Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Look at you... You want to go.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?
For what? A couple hundred bucks?	I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.	It's what I do. It's my job.
It's what I do. It's my job.	Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?	Do you have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.	I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.	Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.	Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?	I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.	It's more than that.
It's more than that.	Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.	So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?	No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.	How do you know I will?
How do you know I will?	Intuition.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.	Don't ruin this for me.
How do you deal with --	WHAT?
WHAT?	I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.	Sounds respectable.
Sounds respectable.	Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.	You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.	You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?	Glenn talked you out of it.
Glenn talked you out of it.	Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
He was looking out for you.	"Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to ""fuck some sense into me."""
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.	Lily... Jesus Christ...
Lily... Jesus Christ...	After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?	I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.	You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Jesus... Take it easy.	No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.	Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.	Everyone's working an angle, right?
Everyone's working an angle, right?	There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about...	What about what?
What about what?	What about the money?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?	No, I want my cut!
No, I want my cut!	I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Sorry. I didn't know...	Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
You got my cell. Leave a message.	It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?	You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
"You tell them the ""Tale""."	What do you want? An apology?
What do you want? An apology?	No, I want my cut!
Tick-tock...	If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.	Your mess.
Your mess.	Then shut up.
Then shut up.	My place.
Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?
Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.	Miles...
Miles...	Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
It's bad luck.	Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...	He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...	Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?	I'm getting a ride.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?	Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
We're working for the King.	Wait a second... Who's the mope?
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.	What do we need another Shill for?
What do we need another Shill for?	Breasts.
Why?	Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Uh...	What?
What?	I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?	Good point.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.	Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...	Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?	We never had a problem with that before.
We never had a problem with that before.	Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.	What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.	We're getting a little old for running.
We're getting a little old for running.	"Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed."
"Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed."	I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
Is it all fugasi?	No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.	Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Him.	You sure?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...	Where the hell is she?
"So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, ""You're fired! Your whole team's fired!"" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --"	But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
What do we do? We change the scam?	There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!	Escorts!
Escorts!	Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.	And we got rid of the red head.
And we got rid of the red head.	Jake? Customs?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.	Do you have a ticket?
Do you have a ticket?	You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.	You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.	What was it?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.	That's no problem. We have those in stock.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.	Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?	With identification.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?	I'm sorry.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	This is embarrassing.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.	You going to have the time?
You going to have the time?	I'll find the time.
King ain't gonna like this.	Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.	What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.	Of what? They're both crooks.
Of what? They're both crooks.	Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.	My fucking heart bleeds.
My fucking heart bleeds.	Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.	Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.	Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
What'd he say?	Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.	Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.	You're a weasel.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?	Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.	That was fucking deep.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?	Keep it up.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.	That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.	What?
What?	Stand up.
Stand up.	No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
What happened?	Eee Oott Auught!
Eee Oott Auught!	Sorry. What?
Sorry. What?	HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...	You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Aces, Suits.	Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?	Pretty much.
Pretty much.	In over your head?
In over your head?	Pretty much.
Can I speak to you in confidence?	Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.	A little bit of both.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.	"I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy."" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"
"I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy."" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"	Can't say.
Can't say.	Then who's the Banker?
Then who's the Banker?	The King.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.	I can handle it.
I can handle it.	I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?	It's not history.
It's not history.	So what do you want?
So what do you want?	I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.	Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
Still time.	Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.	Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Ten percent.	You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.	Confidence. It's just confidence.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?	We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
Just a tip.	What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
What?	Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.	A Fed? Is he close?
A Fed? Is he close?	I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Speak.	He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.	So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?	I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.	Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
Special Agent?	You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.	Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?	I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --	Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Did he buy it?	I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?	Let's just say he burned me once.
You guys awake?	We're here.
Who?	I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
"Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His ""Fix."""	What do you want?
What do you want?	You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.

This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.	What do you get out of it?
What do you get out of it?	Peace of mind.
Peace of mind.	That's it?
That's it?	Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.	Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?	Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.	You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.	Roger that.
You sell it.	To who?
To who?	Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...	You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.	What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.	It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.	Whoa, whoa... There he is.
You trust this Moonan guy?	I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.	It's just insurance.
It's just insurance.	That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.	I'm down!
What are you doing?	High five.
High five.	Put your hand down. I don't high five.
I'm Bella.	Jack Manfred.
Jack Manfred.	Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.	Is it that bad?
Is it that bad?	How do I look?
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.
No. Thanks.	My car's in the garage.
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.
Maybe another time.	I'll take you up on that.
I'll take you up on that.	Goodnight.
You're shaking.	It's the tension.
I hate cheats.	All men are cheats.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.	Why did you quit?
Why did you quit?	I got scared.
I got scared.	I can imagine.
I can imagine.	Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.	You called the casino a cesspit.
You called the casino a cesspit.	Well it is. But I know where I am.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.	I despise the job.
I despise the job.	Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
The Indian rope-trick.	Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.	Not like Matt, you mean.
Not like Matt, you mean.	"Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? ""I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission."" The shit!"
Ouch.	Sorry.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.	I don't know anything about it.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.	Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.	You're all scumbags.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?	A couple I know are getting married.
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
What's the Blue Book price?	That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
How about five hundred.	What?!
What?!	How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.	Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.	Eight-fifty.
Eight-fifty.	Seven-fifty.
Three years, two months. March '93.	What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?	She went back to South Africa.
She went back to South Africa.	Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.	We all played the field.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...	I want a job, Giles.
I want a job, Giles.	All right. As what?
All right. As what?	I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?	We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!	I'm working on that soccer story.

Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.	It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Last hand.	Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
I get it.	Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?	Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.

In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.	How did you land that?
How did you land that?	It came my way. 450 a week.
It came my way. 450 a week.	450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?

This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.	Do you have to swear all the time?
Do you have to swear all the time?	Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.	Marion, stop this.

I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.	I'm on at nine.
I'm on at nine.	Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't like it.	Why not?
Why not?	I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.	He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.

Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.	It's the truth.
It's the truth.	Without hope there's no point to anything.
Without hope there's no point to anything.	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.	Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
The door, Jack.	Leave it.
Leave it.	No. Answer it!
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
I hope it brings you luck.	It will.
That girl, she works at the casino --	-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?	You're entitled to your opinion.
You're entitled to your opinion.	It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.	You will?
You will?	Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
You were talking in your sleep.	Not talking. Writing.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?	Never. Why do you ask?
Never. Why do you ask?	I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Gambling's not about money.
Gambling's not about money.	Really?
Really?	Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
How did you know I was here?	I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
There was a message, wasn't there?	It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.	Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?	Nothing about you.
Nothing about you.	Then what?
Then what?	Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.
Leave me alone, Marion.	You're already alone.
Why did you take the money?	I hate public transport.
I hate public transport.	What?
What?	I want to buy a car.
I want to buy a car.	How can anyone be that naive?
Great.	Found a job?
Found a job?	No.
No.	Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...	It's not that.
It's not that.	I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.	All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
So how are you doing, dad?	Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that	Yes, I know that.
Yes, I know that.	Don't let yourself down.
Don't let yourself down.	I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.	You know where I'm from?
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
Oh hello.	You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.	It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.

Absolutely not.	Toss you for it.
Toss you for it.	I don't gamble.
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
Just an accident. Nothing.	Turn left ahead.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.	That's fine.
He doesn't gamble.	I'll watch.
What happened?	Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?	You don't like cheats, do you.
Which side do you like?	You choose.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.	It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.	I didn't.
I didn't.	Then you're not a pro.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?

And I thought you were a bright woman.	Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.	Robbery's not criminal?
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.	You're serious.
You're serious.	You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
And I thought you were only after my body.	I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.	What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?	It won't.
It won't.	But if it does.
But if it does.	You keep the ten thousand pounds.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.	What ten thousand pounds?
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.	Reynolds? You've done your research.
Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.	I can't do it, Jani.
I can't do it, Jani.	I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...
Wait a minute...	No, forget it. The bet's off.
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
Let it go.	Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?	I told you, all bets are off.
I'm sorry.	What for?
What for?	I have to take the car.
Is it yes?	Yes.
Yes.	Thank you.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.	Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.	It's all relative.  I need the money too.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.	Do you?

And your hand too.	I took the bandage off yesterday.
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
I don't think we should meet again.	It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Hello...	Jack! It's Jani.
Jani! Where are you?	Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.	How are you?
How are you?	Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.	Did you solve your problems?
Did you solve your problems?	Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Detective Inspector Ross.	Who...
Who...	Ross.
Ross.	Who did it? Tell me!
Of course I recognised him!	You did?
You did?	I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
You've been avoiding me.	Have I?
Have I?	I'm Lucy.
I'm Lucy.	And what do you do, Lucy?
And what do you do, Lucy?	I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?	Are you going to put a spell on me?
Are you going to put a spell on me?	I might.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Where to?	Turn left at the lights.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
Over the river.	Have you got transport?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.	Thanks.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.
Nice car.	She's my baby.
She's my baby.	How long have you worked at the casino?
How long have you worked at the casino?	Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.	You've done pretty well.
You've done pretty well.	Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.	No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.	I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.	Some other time.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.	What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?	That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.	I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.	I'm not going to report it.
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.	I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?	Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.	So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.

You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?	Has he?
Has he?	In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?

It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.	Good call.
You want me to check?	I said good call.

You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino.

This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.	Very impressive.
Very impressive.	We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
You can start Monday week.	Fine.
Fine.	That hair will have to go.
That hair will have to go.	Fine.
I just want the job.	Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.	All right, Mr Reynolds.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.	Does he win?
Does he win?	He's a good customer.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.	I can see.
Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.	She was a real asset. But what could I do?
How do you feel, Jack?	Bruised.
Bruised.	Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.	Right, that checks out here.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.	What flickering light?
What flickering light?	The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.	Oh. What's wrong now?
Oh. What's wrong now?	I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.	I hope it's not the oven again.
I hope it's not the oven again.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --	Eventual supernova.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.	Look, bomb...
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
The key!	Key? Key? What is the key?
Key? Key? What is the key?	No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!	Key?
Key?	Where's the fail-safe key?
Where's the fail-safe key?	The key!
The key!	Where is it? What did you do with it?
Where is it? What did you do with it?	I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.	You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
The key, goddamit, the key!	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!	Where is the key?
Where is the key?	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It didn't go off.	Oh, God...
Oh, God...	It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
We've got to disarm the bomb.	Doolittle, are you there?
What was that, I didn't hear...	It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
What the hell?	Yoo hoo, bomb...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.	Time to start talking.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?	Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.	Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.	Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...	Fuck that shit.
Fuck that shit.	Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...	It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?	Well, there's the possibility of...
Well, there's the possibility of...	Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?	All right, then...
All right, then...	So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.	Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.	Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?	He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Quantum is up thirty-five.	I read the same here.
Rechannel all safety relays --	-- open quantum latches --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.	Talby, can you read me?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
Energy shielding positive function.	Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?	Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.	All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?	Check at six minutes.
Check at six minutes.	Arm yourself, bomb.
Armed.	Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.	Thanks.
Thanks.	Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?	Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
Energy shielding positive function.	Do you remember the detonation time?
Do you remember the detonation time?	Detonation in twenty minutes.
Detonation in twenty minutes.	Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.	Armed.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.	Thanks.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.	I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.	You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?	No.
You are false data.	Huh?
Huh?	Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.	Hello, bomb.
Hello, bomb.	False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.	Hey, bomb.
Hey, bomb.	The only thing which exists is myself.
The only thing which exists is myself.	Bomb?
Snap out of it, bomb.	In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Hey, bomb...	And I saw that I was alone.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?	I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.	Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
Of course.	Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?	I am always receptive to suggestions.
I am always receptive to suggestions.	Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.	But how do you know you exist?
But how do you know you exist?	It is intuitively obvious.
It is intuitively obvious.	Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?	Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.	That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?	My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.	Right!
Right!	This is fun.
This is fun.	All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.	In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.	Exactly.
Exactly.	Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.	That's it.
That's it.	Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.	Why don't you have more time?
Why don't you have more time?	Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?	To explode, of course.
To explode, of course.	And you can only do it once, right?
And you can only do it once, right?	That is correct.
That is correct.	And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?	Of course not.
Of course not.	Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.	Yes, well...
Yes, well...	So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.	I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.	Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.	True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.	Hmmm...
Hmmm...	So if you detonate in...
So if you detonate in...	...nine seconds...
...nine seconds...	...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.	I have no proof that it was false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.	You have no proof that it was correct data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?	Mafhkin oble groop...
Mafhkin oble groop...	Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?	I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.	I'll check it.
Pinback...	Yes, Doolittle.
Yes, Doolittle.	Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.	Doolittle...
Doolittle...	Yes.
Yes.	I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.	In a second.
In a second.	Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.	Which one?
Which one?	Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.	Any planets?
Any planets?	Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.	Any of 'em any good?
Any of 'em any good?	Naah. All stable.
What are you gonna name it?	What?
What?	The new star. What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell would have named it.	Commander Powell is dead.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.	Fred.
Fred.	Wha?
Wha?	I hereby name this star Fred.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?	Out where?
Out where?	Veil nebula.
Veil nebula.	Who cares?

I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?	Oh, sure.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?	Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?	Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
TALBY!	Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I need a diameter approximation.	Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.	I like it up here.
I like it up here.	Must get lonely being up here so much.
Must get lonely being up here so much.	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...	...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...	...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...	You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...	You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...	Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
You know what I think about, Talby?	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I'm getting something here, on this readout...	It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...	I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.	I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.	Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...	The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...	I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...	Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.	...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...	I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.	Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.	I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.	I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?	Yes, Talby, what is it?
Yes, Talby, what is it?	Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.

The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.	Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?	Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.	Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...	Not now!
Not now!	Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Doolittle! Help me.	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?	Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.	What happened, Doolittle?
What happened, Doolittle?	Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.	When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...	Guess you're right.
Oh yeah?	Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!	Phoenix?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.	No kidding?
No kidding?	I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...	Yeah?
Yeah?	Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.	I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.	I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.	Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.	Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.	What's that, sir?
What's that, sir?	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?	Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.	Ah... pity, pity...
Ah... pity, pity...	You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.	Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?	Yes sir. Negative effect.
Yes sir. Negative effect.	What was that, Doolittle?
What was that, Doolittle?	Negative effect.
Negative effect.	It didn't work?
It didn't work?	That's correct, sir.
That's correct, sir.	Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.	What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.	Well, what you might try is --
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!	Doolittle, hello?
Doolittle, hello?	Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.	Sorry.
Sorry.	What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?	Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Commander? Are you still there?	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.	We're running out of time, sir.
We're running out of time, sir.	Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.	Sir?
Sir?	Talk to the bomb.
Talk to the bomb.	I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.	No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.	Sir?
Sir?	Phenomenology...
Men... men... what happened, men?	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Who are you?	Bruno's girlfriend.
Bruno's girlfriend.	Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
Yeah.	But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.	No?
No?	No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?	How I make my living, what's your point?
How I make my living, what's your point?	This.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.	I'm on a break.
I'm on a break.	Guess again.
No wire.	Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.	Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.	Yeah, sure, I understand.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.	Yeah?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Man, you got a bad attitude.	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.	What?
What?	That's not why we're here.
That's not why we're here.	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.	You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.	What're you talkin' about?
What're you talkin' about?	I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.	That's a lotta crap.
That's a lotta crap.	Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.	How come I never hearda you before?
How come I never hearda you before?	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.	He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.	What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?	Who's Camille?
Who's Camille?	None of your business.
None of your business.	This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.	You know each other?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
Leave.  Now.	Can I say something in my defense?
Can I say something in my defense?	No.
Move it.	Where?
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
You mean until you showed up?	You're not still pissed?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?	Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Do you know why I went after Justine?	She was there...
She was there...	Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.	And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.	Could you give us a moment.
Why would I be pissed?	It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.	I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?	I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
What are you doing here?	I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.	You're roommates?
What is it?	Police drone.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.	What?  Where're we going?
Lemme put some clothes on.	No time.
Out there.	No way.
No way.	Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?	So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.	"Like de prophets say, ""Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."""
Which is none of your business...or mine.	It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.	Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Where'd you clip this?	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.	Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.	Same old story.  Not interested.
Same old story.  Not interested.	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
What're you looking for?	A grand.
A grand.	Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.	I ain't mad at you...
I ain't mad at you...	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.	Later.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.	I don't get involved with guns.
I don't get involved with guns.	I'll make it worth your while.
I'll make it worth your while.	It's a rule.
You're light a deuce.	Am I?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?	I got overhead...
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.	Yeah, me too.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--	Yech...
What a creep.	And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.	You didn't...
You didn't...	Every week.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!	SHHH!  Don't do that!
Damn... Are you alright?	They took my daughter.
They took my daughter.	I know.
I know.	I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.	Can you help me get her back?
Can you help me get her back?	Look, I'd really like to...
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?	We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.	What else can we do?
What else can we do?	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...	Hello...
Hello...	Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--	I don't want to move away.
I don't want to move away.	I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--	But why can't we stay here?
But why can't we stay here?	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.	Are we in some kind of trouble?
Are we in some kind of trouble?	No...
No...	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Sophy?  Are you okay?	Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, where are you?	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.	When?
When?	Soon, baby.
Soon, baby.	Mommy, I'm scared.
Mommy, I'm scared.	There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
You're a thief?	Girl's gotta make a living.
Girl's gotta make a living.	Thank God.
Thank God.	First time I ever heard that.
First time I ever heard that.	I was expecting someone else.
I was expecting someone else.	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.	Whoever that is.
Whoever that is.	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.	Who is...
Who is...	The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...	We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--	Logan Cale.
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
Lemme get my coat.	The one you're wearing?
How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
Wasn't that hard.	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.	So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?

Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.

You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.	My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?	Right here someplace.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.	Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.

Thank you.	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.	Then what?
Then what?	Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.	Nothing on Hannah?
Nothing on Hannah?	A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.	Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--	You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.

Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--	More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
As long as you're okay.	I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.	Here's your money.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.	How's this about me?
How's this about me?	They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.

Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?	You're crazy.
You're crazy.	I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.	Bastard...
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.	You and me both.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.	Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.	Got a pencil?

Just give it to me.  I'll remember.	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.	I'm on my way.

At least he didn't swing with your ride.	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--	Straight.
Straight.	Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.	What guys do.  'Nother order.

That's odd...	What?
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?	You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.	No.
No.	He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...	A little what?

If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.	How long you and me known each other?
How long you and me known each other?	A long time.
A long time.	Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?	Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.	And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--	A fog bank.
A fog bank.	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Gotta go.	Where?
Where?	It's a secret.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.	Unlikely.

Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now.	Not right now?  Okay, when?
Not right now?  Okay, when?	Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.

I actually know how this works.	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.	Pull the cash.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.

She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.	She's got my word.
She's got my word.	She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
You get it when I get her.	Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?	You're the best, Maxie.
Playing hooky again?	Feel like the dog's dinner.
Feel like the dog's dinner.	Probably a touch of what's going around.
Probably a touch of what's going around.	I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.	What if he's on the level?
What if he's on the level?	Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.

Catch you back at the wall.	Later.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.	Right, the big one-oh.
Right, the big one-oh.	But I'll take a rain check...
Hey, Sketchy--	We gotta talk.
We gotta talk.	What's up?
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.	I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.

Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.	And why should she?
And why should she?	Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.	You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.

That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--	Shut-up...
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.	I was on call.

You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.	Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
What about this?	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.	Theo's dead.
Thanks, miss.	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.	Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.	Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.	Huh?
Huh?	I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
What the hell is that?	Gin.
Gin.	Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.	Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?	Who's Whiskey Dick?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.	My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?	Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
You love him?	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...	No, I mean... you love your son?
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
More than anything in the world.	And he loves you back, doesn't he?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.	Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.	I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?	Hawk.
Hawk.	Pick a song, Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.	Got any KISS?
Got any KISS?	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?	Yeah, a man's drink...
What's that?	You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.	Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Whoa... she is a killer.	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.	I-I c-can't...
I-I c-can't...	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
No problem.	Thanks.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Jeremiah?	Yeah?
Beth? I can't believe it.	Believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.	I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.	Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.	You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
We've got to take this slow...	Right, slow...
Right, slow...	Oh, screw it!
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?	I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.	Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?	Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?	I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Ann Arbor?	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?	Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.	That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.	Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.	Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.	Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?	What's it worth to you?
What's it worth to you?	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?	What? That's disgusting!
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?	You got in the car, didn't you?
You got in the car, didn't you?	Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.	Whatever... stella.
What are you, high?	Yeah.
Yeah.	For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.	Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Namely?	"Our band ""Mystery"" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere."
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.	Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.	I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.	Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.	What's in Sandusky?
What's in Sandusky?	Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.	Disco blows dogs for quarters.
What was that D.J.'s name again?	Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?	Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?	Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
...at twenty-thirty hours.	One more time in English.
One more time in English.	For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Any luck?	Plenty, but it was all bad.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.	Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Shit, that dork is Jam.	YO, DOOFUS!
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.	Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!	Check!
That's Sherry VanHafton.	I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Whoa... she just farted.	I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.	Weird...
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...	Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!	So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?	We are not stealing my mom's car.
We are not stealing my mom's car.	Damn straight we are.
Damn straight we are.	Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.	And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?	Sunday, but...
Sunday, but...	Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?	The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar	Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.	Curly.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Now, how are we gonna do this?	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.	Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?	Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
What the fuck!	The paint!
Uh... dudes?	Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.	DUDES!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.	Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.	...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...	Cool, bro, now listen up...
Cool, bro, now listen up...	...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!	Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
I think we should try sneaking in.	Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.	"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"
"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"	Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
I found the Volvo.	Tickets?
No... You don't think...?	Nah. Couldn't be.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Could be.	And if it ain't cleaned off?
Are you gettin' wise with me?	No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.	Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?	Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.	Oh, yeah...?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?	Sure.
Dude, this is all I got.	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.	Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?	The easy way.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.	I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.	Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.	Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.	Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.	Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Jam, listen up.	Hawk?
Hawk?	Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.	It's my Bullworker.
It's my Bullworker.	Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!	What's gone?
What's gone?	The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!	Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?	Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Cool.	I'm really sorry about that, man.
I'm really sorry about that, man.	Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?	Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.	They're what?
They're what?	She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.	All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.	Check.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?	Check.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?	What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.	Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.	Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.	Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.	Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.	Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
It was stolen!	Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.	Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
I got...	Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Wait! I know how we can get in!	Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.	But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.	See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.	Go ahead, Jam.
Go ahead, Jam.	We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Oh, hi, mom.	NOW!
Jeremiah, what are you doing?	Uhh... nothing.
Ahh, sunshine.	You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.	Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?	It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.	But, mom!
But, mom!	Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
They're not idiots.	Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?	Grounded for the rest of the year?
Grounded for the rest of the year?	You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.	You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?	What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.	What?!
What?!	I said, I'm sorry!
I said, I'm sorry!	If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Mom, what're we...?	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?	I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.	Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?	Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.	That's it?
That's it?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?	No.
No.	Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.	Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.	No...
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.	Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.	Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Well? Continue! Continue!	Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.	Was it a teddy?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.	A bustier?
A bustier?	Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.	Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.	I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.	Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.	What?
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.	You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?	If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?	Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!	Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!	Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
I did it! I did it! We won!	We won?!
"The Chinese have a proverb: ""That which appears too good to be true, usually is."" There's gotta be a catch."	"Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, ""Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole."" We're going this time and that's all there is to it."
Simplicity, Hawk.	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.	Hello summer detention.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.	Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!	Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.	Let's lift up her shirt.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?	Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's gone.	I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
But we took the keys?	Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!	Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Twenty-five more'n I got.	All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.	A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.	No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.	What do you want?
What do you want?	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.	Look, you can have my wallet...
Look, you can have my wallet...	It's not nearly enough, punk.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Two hundred bucks?	You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.	Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?	The KISS Army!
Gimme your gun, boy!	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!	Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!	Not if I shoot first!
Not if I shoot first!	I don't even think you have a gun!
I don't even think you have a gun!	Neither do I!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.	Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?	I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?	Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Is that your final answer?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
I did?	Yeah, you did!
Yeah, you did!	Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!	"Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not ""Taxi Driver."" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and..."
Good morning, mongrels!	Good morning...
Good morning...	"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""	Good MORNING!
Good MORNING!	Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!	GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!	Are you AFRAID?
Are you AFRAID?	GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!	Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Hi... what's going on here?	Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.	What happened?
What happened?	He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
What was his name?	Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I feel bad for his family.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Did you know him?
Dr. Monnitoff?	Donnie.
Donnie.	I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --	Theoretically.
Theoretically.	-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.	A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.	So... that's it?
So... that's it?	The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Like a DeLorean.	A metal craft of any kind.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?	Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.	Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.	Like a spear.
Like a spear.	Beg pardon?
Beg pardon?	Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?	Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.	Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Could these wormholes appear in nature?	That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.	If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.	I'm not following you.
I'm not following you.	If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?	You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.	Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...	Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
When can I squeeze one out?	Not until like... eighth grade.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.	When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.	I'm telling Mom.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?	You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
"""The Last Unicorn!"" By Samantha Darko."	Donnie! Give it back!
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?	I didn't say shit.
I didn't say shit.	That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.	Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.	You know what? I think that you did it.
Dea ex machina...	What did you say?
What did you say?	Our saviour...
How can you do that?	I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Why did you make me flood the school?	We just want to guide you in the right direction.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.	Who is... we?
Who is... we?	You'll know soon enough.
You'll know soon enough.	Where did you come from?
Where did you come from?	Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
I want to show you something.	You have to do something for me first.
You have to do something for me first.	You have a request?
You have a request?	Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.	Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?	Take it off. I want to see you.
What happened to your eye?	I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.	Why do they call you Frank?
Why do they call you Frank?	It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.	How much longer is this gonna last?
How much longer is this gonna last?	You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!	We went to a hotel.
We went to a hotel.	My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?	I don't wanna talk about it.
How old is Grandma Death?	A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!	Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...	Hey...
Hey...	School's cancelled.
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.
Don't look so freaked.	I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.	Fuck them.
So... you just moved here?	Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.	Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?	He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Wow. Did he go to jail?	He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.	I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.	What makes you think I'm not?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.	That's easy. Antiseptics.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.	You mean soap?
You mean soap?	Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.	Wonder where we'll be then.
Wonder where we'll be then.	The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.	Until it withers away.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.	Why is that?
Why is that?	We never would have had this conversation.
You're weird.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	That was a compliment.
That was a compliment.	Will you go with me?
Will you go with me?	Where are we going?
Where are we going?	No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.	Sure.
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.	My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?	No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.	And you'd never been there before?
Donnie?	Yeah?
Yeah?	Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?	Why?
Why?	Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
What happened to your neck?	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?	That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.	With, like, images?
With, like, images?	Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...	And what?
And what?	Well...
Well...	You want to kiss me...
That's alright... I understand.	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...	I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.	Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
We're moving through time.	What?
They suspended me for two days.	Are you okay?
Are you okay?	I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?	Who?
Who?	The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.	Maybe she's asleep.
So, we call them... IMGs.	Infant Memory Generators.
Infant Memory Generators.	Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?	What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?	What do you mean?
Will you please talk to me?	Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.	Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey.	Hey. You OK?
Hey. You OK?	My mom is gone.
My mom is gone.	Where is she?
Where is she?	I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.	But you're OK?
Did you call the cops?	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.	It's safe here.
What?	There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Come with me.	Where are we going?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.	Why? Is this about the book?
Why? Is this about the book?	No. Frank.
No. Frank.	Who's Frank?
Is that a cellar door?	Yeah...
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.	I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.	The Lifeline is divided that way.
The Lifeline is divided that way.	Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.	Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.	Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
People aren't that simple.	If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.	No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
You're such a fuck-ass.	When did you stop taking your medication?
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?	We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?	I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.	You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.	Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Grandma Death.	That is a terrible nickname.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?	Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.	Do you get to meet Ed?
Do you get to meet Ed?	If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?	It feels wonderful.
So how was school today?	It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.	Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.	Do they know yet?
Do they know yet?	Know what?
Know what?	Where it came from?
Where it came from?	No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?	You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Oh, shit!	Grandma Death.
Grandma Death.	You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.	I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Who's been giving you weird looks?	A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
You're my only son...	I know, Dad.
I know, Dad.	I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?	Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Who is Frank?	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.	Why should we care?
Why should we care?	Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.	Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?	Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?	Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.	That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.	What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?	Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
"What's ""Cellar Door""?"	"A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful."
Cellar door.	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?	I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.	Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.	I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.	All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
Would you like to talk about this friend?	His name is Frank.
His name is Frank.	Frank.
Frank.	I think he saved my life.
I think he saved my life.	How so?
How so?	Don't you watch the news?
Don't you watch the news?	I don't own a television.
I don't own a television.	A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.	He said to follow him.
He said to follow him.	Follow him where?
Follow him where?	Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?	No.  That's stupid.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?	Yes.
Yes.	So, tell me about your day, Donald.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.	I met a girl.
I met a girl.	What is her name?
What is her name?	Gretchen. We're going together now.
Gretchen. We're going together now.	Do you think a lot about girls?
Do you think a lot about girls?	Yes.
Yes.	How are things going at school?
How are things going at school?	I think about girls a lot.
I think about girls a lot.	I asked you about school.
I asked you about school.	I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.	What else do you think about during school?
What else do you think about during school?	"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""	Who is the boss?
Who is the boss?	I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.	What about your family, Donnie?
What about your family, Donnie?	No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!	Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
How many times have you seen Frank?	Four times... so far.
Four times... so far.	Can anyone else see him?
Can anyone else see him?	I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.	Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?	I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.	A sign from whom?
A sign from whom?	I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.

My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.	How does that make you feel?
How does that make you feel?	It reminded me of my dog Callie.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.	Is Callie still around?
Is Callie still around?	No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...	Do you feel alone right now?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?	No. That makes you keep searching.
And they grow out of our stomachs?	It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...	What did you find?
Nothing.	Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?	Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...	Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?	You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.	I know.
I know.	I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.	The good stuff.
The good stuff.	Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.	Have you ever made love, Donald?
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?	Yes.
Yes.	So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?	I... I was playing with fire.
I... I was playing with fire.	Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
People get hurt.	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.	People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.	But you were punished.
But you were punished.	Yes. I went to jail.
Yes. I went to jail.	Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?	They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.	What did you want for Christmas that year?
What did you want for Christmas that year?	Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.	How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?	Regret.
Regret.	What else makes you feel regret?
What else makes you feel regret?	That I did it again.
That I did it again.	You've done it again?
You've done it again?	Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.	Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...	If God exists?
If God exists?	I think now that he might...
I think now that he might...	Why?
Why?	Because I'm so horny.
Because I'm so horny.	God exists because you're horny.
God exists because you're horny.	I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.	Where are we going?
Where are we going, Donald?	I have the power to build a time machine.
I have the power to build a time machine.	How is that possible?
How is that possible?	Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.	Then how is time travel possible?
Then how is time travel possible?	It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.	When will this happen?
When will this happen?	Soon. Time is almost up.
What is going to happen?	Frank is going to kill.
Frank is going to kill.	Who is he going to kill?
I can see him right now!	Where is he, Donald?
Where is he, Donald?	He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.	If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

It's too late. I've already ruined my life.	You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.	Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.	Goodbye, Donald.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.	Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."	What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?	Guess who wrote it?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.	Yeah.
Yeah.	What's her name?
What's her name?	You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?	Why would I tell Mom?
Why would I tell Mom?	Because you tell Mom everything.
Because you tell Mom everything.	No I don't.  She worries about you.
No I don't.  She worries about you.	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.	It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.	I was just being honest.
I was just being honest.	Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.	Her name is Gretchen.
Her name is Gretchen.	That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.	Congratulations.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.	Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.	Everything is going to be just fine.
How much are they paying you to be here?	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?	Gerald.
Gerald.	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.	Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.	Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...	What I think is going on with your son.
What I think is going on with your son.	Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?	Come again?
Come again?	Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?	Frank?
Frank?	Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?	He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
I... What can we do?	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
If that's what you think is necessary.	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.	You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
What?	Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?	He was a year ahead of us?
He was a year ahead of us?	He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.	If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Excuse me?	Donnie? You're a dick.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?	That's enough.
That's enough.	You can suck a fuck.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?	How did you know --
How did you know --	I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.	It is a big deal.
It is a big deal.	I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...	Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.	What else?
What else?	What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Christ. Is that an axe?	Yep.
Yep.	How did this happen?
How did this happen?	I guess they made him do it.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.	The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?	"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.	Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Rose.	Kitty...
Kitty...	Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.	Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.	Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.	Beg pardon?
Beg pardon?	Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.	But now you can't go.
But now you can't go.	Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.	Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...	Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...	Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.	Kitty...
Kitty...	The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!	This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...	I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Chut up!	Go back to China, bitch!
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.	You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.	There's no rule!
There's no rule!	Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.	Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
What is this shit?	Raspberry.
Wicked.	No more fuckin' for her.
No more fuckin' for her.	Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.	Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.	Not Vanity. He's a homo.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.	I stole four beers from my dad.
Is Mom okay?	She's alive, sweetie.
She's alive, sweetie.	Where is she?!
Where is she?!	She's right over there.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!	Don't let that worry you, Annette!
You're what?!	I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.	I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!	Oh God, I'm dead...
So, what do I say?	"Simple. Just say, ""Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'."" There. Easy as pie."

Oh my God. I'm so dead...	Yeah, you betcha...
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.	No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
"""Once a carnie, always a carnie."""	Oh-yah.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.	Really, Loretta?
Really, Loretta?	You-betcha.
You-betcha.	My mom wanted me to have this?
My mom wanted me to have this?	Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.	Loretta, never have kids.
Loretta, never have kids.	Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.	Thank God for bunge cords.
Thank God for bunge cords.	...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
What is wrong with you?	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.	You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.	Really?
Really?	No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.	Okay.
Okay.	Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.	This came for you, sweetie.
This came for you, sweetie.	Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
"It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a ""personal consultation"" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!"	What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.	I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!	Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...	There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
"All right, say ""Airport Ho-Jo."""	Airport Ho-Jo!
Airport Ho-Jo!	I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Loretta, don't do that.	I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.	I gotta work with these women.
I gotta work with these women.	Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!	Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!	I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Oh, Amber...	I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.	I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Amber? Here.	"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"
"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"	My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
"Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one ""Liza"" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me."	Your parents'd kill you.
Your parents'd kill you.	Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.	Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.	"Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a ""skinny little fag"" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back."
"Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a ""skinny little fag"" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back."	Yah?
Yah?	Oh-you-beccha.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Mrs. Leeman?	Huh?
Huh?	I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.	Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.

My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.	But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.	"Well, your ""cheap whore"" is this family's ""lovin' mother.""  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."
"Well, your ""cheap whore"" is this family's ""lovin' mother.""  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."	-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Amber...	No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
I'm gonna need more caps.	You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.	"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""
"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""	No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.	Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?	That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Oh shit!	They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.	Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.	Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Go on! Get out!	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Mom!	I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.	Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.	What?!
Ow!	Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.	You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.	Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.	"Let me tell you ""scary,"" Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a ""lifer"" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent ""raisin ranch"" where they'll change me twice a day."
"Let me tell you ""scary,"" Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a ""lifer"" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent ""raisin ranch"" where they'll change me twice a day."	That's it, I'm goin'...
That's it, I'm goin'...	Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.	It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.	C'mere. I love you so much.
C'mere. I love you so much.	I love you much.

"Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your ""Physical Fitness"" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies."	No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
I hate her!	We all do. Now let's go.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?	Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.	But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?	Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.	This, this... This is bullshit!
This, this... This is bullshit!	Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!	Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
What're you doin' here?	Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
What?	You heard me. Where is it?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.	I just did.
I just did.	Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.	"Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, ""Come and get it,"" bitch!"
"Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, ""Come and get it,"" bitch!"	"Oh, I'll ""get it."" I'll ""get it"" all right. I might even take seconds."
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.	Bitch!

Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?	"Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, ""Pageants are old-fashioned"" and, uh, and ""demeaning"" to the girls --"
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?	"Last year? It was, ""Buy American."""
"Last year? It was, ""Buy American."""	And the year before that?
And the year before that?	"""U.S.A. is A-okay."""

Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?	"""Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!"" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'."

$50?	I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.

Your Excellency, haven't we met before?	Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
Excellency, may I present my niece.	Go ahead.
Go ahead.	You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.	And Vera niece, too.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --	Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?	What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...	Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
That's what you think.	You swine!
You swine!	Give me that again!
Give me that again!	You worm!
You worm!	Once more!
Once more!	You upstart!
You upstart!	That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Then it's war?	Yes.
Yes.	How're ya fixed for ammunition?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?	Bah!!
Bah!!	THEN IT'S WAR!
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.	Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...	I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.	Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?	I don't remember.
I don't remember.	Oh -- you mean... worm?
Oh -- you mean... worm?	No, that wasn't it...
No, that wasn't it...	Was it -- swine?
Was it -- swine?	No... it was a seven letter word.
No... it was a seven letter word.	Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!	That's it...
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!	I still like UPSTART the best.
What'll I do with this card?	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.	"Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- ""D"" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"

Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.	I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?	Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.	No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.	Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!	You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.	Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.	If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.	These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.	That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.	Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?	I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --	Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...	He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Oh, Rufus!	All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.	Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.	I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...	But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.	Let him patch up his own breeches...
Oh, won't you reconsider...	Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...	Now -- er --
Now -- er --	Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...	Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?	Why -- why -- of course.
Why -- why -- of course.	You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
I hope I'm not interrupting.	Take a seat -- you're next.
Take a seat -- you're next.	Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.	WHAT  ?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --	But -
But -	You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.	The king can do no wrong!
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --	What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.	Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.	Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.	Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --	Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --	Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.	This is terrible!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.	Oh, would you...?
Oh, would you...?	For you, I would do anything...
So that's the one you want to marry.	With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --	Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.	That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Uncle, you can't do this!	My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.	It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...	I thought everything was working out fine.
I thought everything was working out fine.	Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.	Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...	Perhaps he will listen to you...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?	Yes please, two.
Yes please, two.	One or two?
One or two?	Two, please.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.	Oh?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.	How lovely.
They have noble faces.	I've always thought that myself.
I've always thought that myself.	Oh, yes.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.	If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
You won't be long?	I'll join you shortly.
Did it go well, darling?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?	Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?	No, I think a whiskey.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.	I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.	But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?	He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.	Well, these things take time.
Well, these things take time.	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
John loves the house.	Do you?
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
You stay with me.	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
More romances for John?	Hmmm?
Hmmm?	...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.	Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.	Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?	That I am very little different from him.
That I am very little different from him.	Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.	But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?	Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?	...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?	Oh Frederick.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.	Yes?
Yes?	I found it.
I found it.	Did you see it?
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
What is it?	Like this.
Like this.	I'll get my bag.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!	Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.	He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!	He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.	If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
Don't!	Shut up!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.	I intend to.
What happened?	He fell.  He falls.
He fell.  He falls.	He must have taken quite a fall.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.	Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.	That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
This man belongs in hospital.	Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.	"You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his ""fall"". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?	Everything will be seen to.
I want my man back.	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?	Never mind that, I want my man!
Never mind that, I want my man!	He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.	DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!	You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...	Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!	I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.	He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!	All you do is profit from another man's misery!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!	You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.	You don't own this man!
You don't own this man!	I want him back!
I want him back!	So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!	I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right... Right.
Good morning, Treves.	Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.	You've acquired a taste for this?
You've acquired a taste for this?	It's quite nutritious, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.	Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.	Indeed!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.	Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?	Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.	Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.	Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.	Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?	No, more of an acquaintance.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.	Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?	Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.	Good! How is the patient?
Good! How is the patient?	He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.

I thought he was imbecile?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...	I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.	I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.	"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."
"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."	Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.	Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.	Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?	Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?	Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.	Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.	...Yes, Sir.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.	Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?	Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.	Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Oh yes?	And what was that, John?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.	Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.	I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Treves. Well done.	Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
Yes, I think I can.	No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.	I could easily arrange...
I could easily arrange...	No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?	Well, yes.
Well, yes.	Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.	Do you think they'll go along with us?
Do you think they'll go along with us?	Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Don't we?	No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.	Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
Has the response picked up?	Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.	But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.	Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.	Please do.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...	Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
How are you feeling today?	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?	I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?	I feel much better. Thank you.
I feel much better. Thank you.	Are you comfortable here?
Are you comfortable here?	Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.	Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
...everyone has been very kind.	Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
What is it, Treves?	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.	I am very pleased to meet you.
I am very pleased to meet you.	I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
How long has this man been here?	Three quarters of an hour.
Three quarters of an hour.	Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.	What a mess.
I say Freddie, what are you about?	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.	Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.	I don't know what I've got.
I don't know what I've got.	Nothing of any importance, eh?
You never mentioned his mental state.	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?	"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.	What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.	"I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say ""I love you"". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."
Good day...!	I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.	Oh, no.
Oh, no.	I knew you'd understand. Here.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.	Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
She's very pretty, your mother.	Yes.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.	Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?	You've never been?
You've never been?	Alas, no.
Alas, no.	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.	Tell me about it, please!
Tell me about it, please!	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.

Romance!	That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...	Oh no?
Oh no?	Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.	Good day, Mr. Merrick.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.	I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.	Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.	I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.	How awful for John.
How awful for John.	And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.	Is he... dying then?
Is he... dying then?	Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.	Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...	Yes.
You alright?	y-y-yes--
y-y-yes--	Want to come out?
Want to come out?	You're English.
You're English.	Of course! You want out?
Of course! You want out?	Yes.
Yes.	Won't be a moment.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.	Oh no, my friend...
Oh no, my friend...	Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.	Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.	You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?	Yes.
Thank you very much.	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.	No, nothing.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.	Good morning.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.	Yes.
Yes.	But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.	Thank you... very much.
Thank you... very much.	Where did you get this box?
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!	I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.	It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
What's this?	The main spire.
The main spire.	The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?	...I learned a long time ago.
I'll have to find some more.	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.

Yyyess.	Yyess.
Yyess.	"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."	Yes!

Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?	Hello, my name is John Merrick.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...	Righteousness...
Righteousness...	Righteousness for his namesake.
Righteousness for his namesake.	"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we?

Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?	Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
...Yes potatoes... but...	But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?	You did not ask me.
You did not ask me.	I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?	Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.	We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?	Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
This... is my new home?	Yes.
Yes.	The hospital?
The hospital?	Of course! What did you think?
How long will I stay here?	I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
You look splendid, John.	Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.	When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?	I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?	That's a canopy, John.
That's a canopy, John.	Ohhh...
Ohhh...	How is your tea, John?
How is your tea, John?	It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.	Not at all, John.
Not at all, John.	I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?	Oh yes.
Oh yes.	Who are they of?
Who are they of?	Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh, our relatives... the children.	The children! May I see?
The children! May I see?	Of course.
The Children. Where are your children	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.	Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
Your mother?	Here.
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
Good morning.	John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?	Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...	Yes, John?
Yes, John?	...Can you cure me?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.	I thought as much.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.	Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.	Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
You want a dressing bag, John?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
...my... home?	Yes, John.
Yes, John.	You did this for me?
You did this for me?	Yes.
Yes.	Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
My home.	There is one more thing, John. Here.
Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.	Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Mr. Treves! Treves.	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
Oh no, I couldn't.	It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?	Yes, very soon.
Yes, very soon.	Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.	Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Oh yes! It was wonderful!	I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Yes John?	Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?	No, John, not one that I can see.
No, John, not one that I can see.	Then I shouldn't change anything?
Then I shouldn't change anything?	No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?	Fine.
Fine.	Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.	I've heard.
I've heard.	Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...	Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?	Yes... Yes, let's go in.
The workhouse.	Yes! The workhouse!
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
No, he's very upset about something.	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
"He's had his share of ""smacks"", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.	Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Watery headed bunch.	I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.	Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.	Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.	I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.	Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...	But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.	Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.	I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.	You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.	Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.	Yes sir.  What's that?
Yes sir.  What's that?	A dressing bag.
A dressing bag.	Very smart indeed.
Very smart indeed.	Yes. John wants it.
Yes. John wants it.	A dressing bag?
A dressing bag?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.	Well...
Well...	John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.	Welcome home, John.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?	Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.	HE'S GONE!
HE'S GONE!	When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.	YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?	YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.	YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
Are you the proprietor?	And who might you be, sir?
And who might you be, sir?	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?	Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?	Pardon me?
Pardon me?	Never mind. I'm the owner.
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
Ah! It's my father!	Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
Who, Father?	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!	There IS no one.
Well... where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!	You're losing your temper!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...	She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.	It's your fantasy...
It's your fantasy...	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
I said welcome.	WELCOME?
WELCOME?	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
What are what?	Those things in your hands.
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!	What?
What?	Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
WHY?	Yes.
Yes.	But surely you know...?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"	No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?	You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?	No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?	What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...	It was different...
It was different...	What was she like?
What was she like?	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...	But you LOVED her all the same...
But you LOVED her all the same...	We never went to bed together.
We never went to bed together.	Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?	I've never LOVED anybody!
I've never LOVED anybody!	I've never been to bed with anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.	"""The fifth one this week""!"
"""The fifth one this week""!"	Oh, for goodness' sake!
Oh, for goodness' sake!	And I thought you said it was something special...
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...	Five this week; how many the week before?
Five this week; how many the week before?	You're as bad as my father.
You're as bad as my father.	And the week before that?
We mustn't let him land!	Who?
Who?	Halfdan the Black.
Halfdan the Black.	But, Erik...
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?	Why?
No!	I'll bring it back.
I'll bring it back.	Erik. You don't understand.
Erik. You don't understand.	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.	But you don't realize....
But you don't realize....	Goodbye, Aud...
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.	That's right!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?	Of course.
Of course.	Do you believe I love you?
Do you believe I love you?	I... but I...
I... but I...	You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?	Yes -- I believe you do.
Yes -- I believe you do.	Then let go!
The second note.	The second note to wake the Gods...
Erik! You've done what you came to do!	Not quite...
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!	There is something I must ask the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...	No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Then I shall come too.	No... no...
No... no...	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?	Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
But --	It was my master Keitel's idea.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?	What d'you mean?
How do we know this is the way?	We blew the Horn Resounding.
We blew the Horn Resounding.	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"	I shouldn't have come.
I shouldn't have come.	They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
What do you see, Erik?	I see the world.
I see the world.	Is it night or day, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?	It is day, of course, Freya.
It is day, of course, Freya.	Is it summer or winter, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.	But have you ever seen it? Think back...
But have you ever seen it? Think back...	Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...	The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
Is there nothing men can do?	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.	I will go and wake them up!
And will the dead ever return, Freya?	That I cannot tell you.
No... we don't...	The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
How?	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.	Well... isn't it great?
Would you like us to sing to you?	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --	You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...	A lot of people like our singing.
A lot of people like our singing.	I'm sure it's lovely.
I'm sure it's lovely.	But you don't want to hear it.
But you don't want to hear it.	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.	You're just saying that.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.	REALLY?
REALLY?	Really.
Really.	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
No.	"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
We're just not a very musical nation...	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.	Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
No.	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...	Well, how d'you think I feel?
Well, how d'you think I feel?	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.	YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
I'll tell you what...	Yes?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...	"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.	Why?
Why?	Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!	Don't talk nonsense.
Don't talk nonsense.	He wants to kill US!
He wants to kill US!	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Is there something the matter with it?	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.	Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?	Yes... oh, yes...
Yes... oh, yes...	Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
But it IS! Look!	The important thing is not to panic.
Have you done this sort of thing before?	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.	Looting and pillaging, eh?
Looting and pillaging, eh?	Yes.
Yes.	What about the raping?
What about the raping?	Shut up.
Shut up.	It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.	Sh!
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.	You don't love ME.
You don't love ME.	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...	What -- rape?
What -- rape?	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?	Oh, get it over with.
Oh, get it over with.	I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose... no...	What?
What?	I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?	What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.	About raping me?
About raping me?	About NOT raping you...
About NOT raping you...	You DON'T like it, do you?
You DON'T like it, do you?	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.	What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.	Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?	To pay for the next expedition, of course.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.	But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!	Well you started it.
Well you started it.	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.	And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Scream.	Ah.
Ah.	Louder.
Louder.	Aaagh! Rape!
Aaagh! Rape!	Oh, thanks.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.	I didn't mean to!
I didn't mean to!	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
You told them I raped you -- why?	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...	Why should you care?
Why should you care?	Why... should YOU care?
Why... should YOU care?	Tell me your name?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.
What a stupid idea.	Why?
Why?	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?	Well... no...
Is THAT Odin?	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.	Odin!
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?	Find it... AND cross it!
"""But"" what?"	But...
But...	What?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.	He was lucky...  Sit there.
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
It's Halfdan the Black!	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?	It saved my father!
How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep... usually...
Let's hack her to pieces.	No.
What's wrong with making friends?	"You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make ""friends""."
That's terrible!	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
Halfdan the Black's here!	I know!
I know!	He wants to KILL us.
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!	I know. I know.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!	Don't you FEEL it?
We're missing all the fun...	What's it all about?
What's it all about?	What?
What?	We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...	You talking piffle, son?
You talking piffle, son?	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?	Who have you been talking to?
Who have you been talking to?	I met this girl...
I met this girl...	It's always the women that start the trouble.
It's always the women that start the trouble.	She got me thinking...
She got me thinking...	So? What'd you do to her?
I... I... KILLED her...	That's my boy!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.	Well, you ARE!
I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!	Sorry.
Slower! In... Out...	Sorry!
Faster!	Make your mind up.
What are YOU doing here?	You may need a real Berserk.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
SHUT UP!	ROW!
Look, the sky is blue...	The sun! That's it!
It's magic.	"What ""magic""?"
"What ""magic""?"	I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"	You'll see!
What did he say?	Look out!
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.	Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.	Why should WE care?
Why should WE care?	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Because... you're... you're the Gods....	So?
So?	Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.	But you're the Gods!
But you're the Gods!	Look... Erik...
You mean we'd be dead?	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Thank you VERY much indeed.	Now stop it!
Now stop it!	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...	Trust me to get the missionary.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.	That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.	Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
That's better.	Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Row!	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!	Well, come on!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.	Like fish.
A magic dishcloth.	To the oars!
Weren't we supposed to?	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
No! Let go, Snorri!	I've got you!
I've got you!	You'll be sucked down too!
You'll be sucked down too!	No! Arrgh!
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
Who gets killed?	Nobody gets killed.
You need to say a bit more than that!	Oh... er... yes...
What's the matter with them?	Just say something cheerful.
Just say something cheerful.	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
I think we should go...	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...	No, don't say anything else!
Wait, Erik!	Keitel Blacksmith?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.	What's the matter with Bjorn?
What do you think?	But how could he know... unless...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.	But...
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!	What is it?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!	What are you talking about?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?	I will join my grandfather there.
What are you talking about, Erik?	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.	We'd be the first!
But HOW?	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
Look, I bagged it last week.	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?	I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.
ROW!	DEATH!
She hasn't got any.	She MUST have a knife or something...
Hy-Brasil?	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...	Over the Edge of the World.
Sven!	Let me do something for myself for a change!
I came to find my grandfather.	I have to go...
Bye, Leif.	Bye... sorry...
Bye... sorry...	Yeah... well...
Yeah... well...	You will wait?
You will wait?	What d'you expect me to do?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.	Please.
What's all the panic about?	The Dragon...
It can't do you any HARM...	What do we have to do?
What do we have to do?	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
How did he do that?	Do what?
Do what?	Vanish into thin air?
Vanish into thin air?	He hasn't.
He hasn't.	Well, where is he then?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.	I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.	You're wasting your time.
You're wasting your time.	Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...	There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.	Same thing, isn't it?
Same thing, isn't it?	No, it is NOT.
You know, my son, our lord said...	Your lord.
Your lord.	"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.	You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
I know. I know.	Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.	Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
He used to puke in his sleep.	Bastard.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?	That's it!
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?	That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.	Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!	Mum! Dad!
Aaagh!	Got you!
Let me go, Sven.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	I'm not worth risking your life for.
I'm not worth risking your life for.	I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...	For your own sake... For the others... I...
For your own sake... For the others... I...	Hang on...
Well! Come on!	I... I...
Who's that?	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...	Oh...
What?	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?	Get away, Snorri.
Get away, Snorri.	What have you got there?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.	Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.	You could charge him what you like.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.	Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...	"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.	Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough swords!	Can't make enough axe-heads!
Can't make enough axe-heads!	But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!	It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.	My brother blacksmiths!
My brother blacksmiths!	That's right.
That's right.	The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.	Together we stand!
Together we stand!	You can't let Erik do THAT.
Wasn't it, Keitel?	Well... I... I thought...
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?	How can we stops him now?
Sh! Hurry!	YOU do it!
YOU do it!	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
I can't swim! I can't swim!	Relax!
Relax!	I'm drowning! Help!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!	Help!
Help!	You'll drown us bo...
Help!	Help!
Shut up!	She knows it was our fault!
She knows it was our fault!	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!	No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
You've lost your mind.	We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!	You fool!
I should have got rid of you long ago!	Like you got rid of Snorri!
Made by YOU, Loki!	By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...	It's not my business any more!
It's a tradition.	I know, Dad.
I know, Dad.	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...	You went berserk...
You went berserk...	I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...	So did your father...
So did your father...	So did my father and his father before him.
So did my father and his father before him.	But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility...	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.	I must only let the red rage...
I must only let the red rage...	You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!	Not now, Sven...
Not now, Sven...	I must KILL! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Well, of course he is!	Sh!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Well, go on! Go berserk!	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
There is nothing we can do...	Helpless...
He drove me mad!	Easy, Dad!
Easy, Dad!	"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."	Dad!
Dad!	I hate you! I hate you!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!	You liar!
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
Well... I'm game.	Me too.
Shut up.	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Thorfinn! You can't die!	I'm not frightened... of anything...
I'm not frightened... of anything...	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!	No... he's not... not... there...
No... he's not... not... there...	Tell him I'm coming!
And you've got BOTH axes?	Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother.	And something to sharpen them with?
And something to sharpen them with?	Yes, Mum.
Yes, Mum.	And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.	No, Mother.
No, Mother.	And keep your sword greased.
And keep your sword greased.	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.	I never do...
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.	She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.	I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
You weren't supposed to see that.	They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.	Sweetie, we called the company.
Thanks, guys.	I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Say hi to Naomi.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.	Just a little overworked, maybe.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.	I did. You said, things were fine.
I did. You said, things were fine.	I remember.
I remember.	This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.	Yeah, you told me that later.
Yeah, you told me that later.	I told you that later.
Who was the girl you walked off with?	No one.
Shit. The last time I saw you.	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?	And I just liked you so much.
And I just liked you so much.	You did? You liked me?
No, it was lovely.	Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
May I help you?	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.	Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Ms. Kruczynski?	Hi.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.	Here we are.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.	You were not.
You were not.	I was not.
Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.	You rat.
You rat.	I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.	In the room?
In the room?	In the world.
Oh, baby, what's going on?	I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.	Oh, Tangerine.
Oh, Tangerine.	Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Come up to Boston with me?	Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --	Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!	Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.	Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
I'm so excited. Yay!	I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.	It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
What's wrong with me?	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?	What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?	I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
I'm sorry.	Why?
Why?	Why what?
Why what?	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.	No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Really?	Well, I didn't want to assume.
Well, I didn't want to assume.	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.	Oh. So...
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --	No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --	It's okay, really.
It's okay, really.	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.	Rockville Center.
Rockville Center.	Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?	The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?	Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.	Really? Because --
Really? Because --	Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.	-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.	Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.	I don't have one.
I don't have one.	I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.	Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?	I like it.
I like it.	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --	Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?	I can't remember.
I can't remember.	Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.

I don't really know how --	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.	I'm sure you would.
I'm sure you would.	My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.	You sure? That doesn't sound --
You sure? That doesn't sound --	I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?	Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?	Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.	Yeah, I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.	I'm Joel.
I'm Joel.	No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.	I don't know any jokes about your name.
I don't know any jokes about your name.	Huckleberry Hound?
Huckleberry Hound?	I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.	Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?	I'm not nuts.
I'm not nuts.	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?	"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"
"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"	Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.	See, I wouldn't think that about you.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.	Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?	Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --	Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.	Well, anyway... Sorry.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Okay.
Okay.	Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Joel? It's Joel, right?	Yes?
Yes?	I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.	That's okay.
That's okay.	"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."
"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."	It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --	Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.	Probably see you at the book store.
Probably see you at the book store.	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.	You're sure? It's cold.
You're sure? It's cold.	I don't want to take you out of your way.
I don't want to take you out of your way.	It's okay.
It's okay.	Yeah?
Where do you live?	You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.	You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.	I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker.	You know Wilmont?
You know Wilmont?	Yeah.
Yeah.	Wilmont. Near the high school.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.	It's okay. I didn't think you were.
So you like bookstores, huh?	I like to read.
I like to read.	Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.	Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --	"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"
"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"	Sort of, um...
Sort of, um...	"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."
"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."	What?
What?	"I'm just a bit of a wreck. ""I sleep in your hat"" makes me cry.  Me."
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Take care.	Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --	Um --
Um --	Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
You like that?	Very much.
Very much.	This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.	Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.	Frost?
Frost?	Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?	It's pretty.
It's pretty.	I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!

God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.
I'm fine.	Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.
You pick it.	You just say. I'm not really --
You just say. I'm not really --	I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?	No. I --
No. I --	I know a man who needs a refill.
Thanks.	Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.	Yeah?
Yeah?	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?	I don't know.
I don't know.	Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?	Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.	Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?	Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.	But I think I am. I like to think I am.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.	It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.	Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.	I think about that.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.	I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.	I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.	Thanks.
Thanks.	And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?

Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --	Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?	Yeah.
Yeah.	You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?	No.
No.	I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?	No, not at all.
No, not at all.	I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.	Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.	That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.	That's scary sounding.
That's scary sounding.	Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?

I think so.	I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.	Okay.
Okay.	Yeah? Oh, great!
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --	Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.	You should stay.
You should stay.	I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...	Okay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.	You'll call me, right?
You'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Yeah.	When?
When?	Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.	Okay.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?	You didn't say anything about my hair.
Yo ho ho!	It's three.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.	...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.	Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.	Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
Where are you going?	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
I want to have a baby.	Let's talk about it later.
Let's talk about it later.	No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.	I don't think we're ready.
I don't think we're ready.	You're not ready.
You're not ready.	Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
I don't want to talk about this here.	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!	Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --	I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Oh, thank God. It's going.	It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
So, um --	Would you get me another, Joely?
You're drunk.	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.	No, it isn't that.
No, it isn't that.	I want to know you.
I want to know you.	I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.	Joel, you're a liar.
More?	No. Thanks.
Joely...	Yeah, Tangerine?
Yeah, Tangerine?	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	No.
No.	"It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, ""It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
Such a beautiful view.	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!	Oh?
Oh?	I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.	Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?	I don't know.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.	I'm right here.
I'm right here.	I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.	I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
You remember what happened next?	I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --	-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
There's this guy!	What?
What?	There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.	Really? Is he cute?
Really? Is he cute?	He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!	Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.	Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Joel!	I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Happy Birthday.	Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I scoured the city for it.	I love it!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.	Yeah.
Yeah.	I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.	"This is our first ""date"" date."
"This is our first ""date"" date."	Do you remember what we talked about?
Do you remember what we talked about?	Naomi, I guess.
Naomi, I guess.	Yeah.
Yeah.	What was I wearing?
What was I wearing?	God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.	Egad, were you horrified?
Egad, were you horrified?	No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.	We did talk about Naomi.
We did talk about Naomi.	I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.	I'm sure, I said.
I'm sure, I said.	But you weren't. I could tell.
But you weren't. I could tell.	I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:	So what. Infatuation is good, too.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.	And I didn't have an argument.
I dropped you off after. You said --	Come up and see me... now.
Come up and see me... now.	It's very late.
It's very late.	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?	I did it. I guess that means something.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.	Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.	Yeah?
Yeah?	I'd like to... take you out or something.
I'd like to... take you out or something.	Well, you're married.
Well, you're married.	Not yet. Not married.
Not yet. Not married.	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.	Okay.
Okay.	So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.	I remember that speech really well.
I remember that speech really well.	I had you pegged, didn't I?
I had you pegged, didn't I?	You had the whole human race pegged.
You had the whole human race pegged.	Probably.
Probably.	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.	I know.
I know.	It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.	Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Hi there.	Hi.
You said...	I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.	Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
You know what I did.	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.	You said --
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?	And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Oh God, how horrid.	I'm Joel.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?	Yeah, like that.
Yeah, like that.	Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.	I know.
I know.	What do we do?
What do we do?	Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.	I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.	But my sleeping is really fucked up.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.	I don't think I've slept in a year.
I don't think I've slept in a year.	You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.	yeah?
yeah?	I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.	Okay.
Okay.	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?	I love her.
I love her.	Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.	I think she's great.
I think she's great.	Me too. There's this poem --
Me too. There's this poem --	Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?	I think, before.
I think, before.	Seems too coincidental that way.
Seems too coincidental that way.	Yeah, maybe.
"Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."	"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"
"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"	Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.
Um, no.	Let's move into this neighborhood.
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
Male or female?	Female.
Female.	At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Cool.	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	It's freezing out here.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I knew.	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.	It's dark.
It's dark.	Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?	Naomi.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.	I think we should go.
I think we should go.	No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
So go.	"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."
"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."	What if you stay this time?
What if you stay this time?	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.	Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.	I love you.
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Yeah.	When?
When?	Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.	Yeah.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.	I don't know.
I don't know. What if it breaks?	What if?
I think I should go back.	Joel, come here. Please.
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?
Make love?	Have sex. Y'know --
Have sex. Y'know --	Oh, um...
Oh, um...	Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.	That's okay. I --
That's okay. I --	I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --	Hey, Joel --
Hey, Joel --	-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.	I'm nervous, too.
I'm nervous, too.	Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.	Well, you obviously don't know me.
Well, you obviously don't know me.	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.	Says you were a bully...
Says you were a bully...	A bully? Moi?
A bully? Moi?	That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.	Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.	Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.	"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."
"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."	I don't know.
I don't know.	Doesn't sound like me.
Doesn't sound like me.	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.	Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?	I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.	We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
"You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock."""	I can't stop thinking about you.
I can't stop thinking about you.	Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --	I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
I just walked in.	Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?	Oddly enough, I do.
Oddly enough, I do.	Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.	I guess so.
I guess so.	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Yeah?	Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?	I probably got the same thing as you.
I probably got the same thing as you.	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?	Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.	That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
It's true.	I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.	Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Hi, it's Joel.	Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.	You must have been crazy.
You must have been crazy.	Guess what I'm wearing.
Guess what I'm wearing.	I don't know. Panties and --
I don't know. Panties and --	Your dried cum.
Your dried cum.	Jesus.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.	Hi.
Hi.	How's it going?
How's it going?	Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.	I know. I had to take the day to think.
I know. I had to take the day to think.	Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?	I just got in.
I just got in.	Long day thinking.
That's me.	There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
It was snowing.	There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.	I'm like a joke to them.
I might be making a mistake.	Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.	Fuck you, Clementine.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.	The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
It's them.	It's too late.
I should maybe talk to you.	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Clementine.	That's your look for me.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
So then she just stops calling.	I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.	Any messages, Carmen?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...	And what are you like? A wino?
How's the chicken?	Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
She's so sexy.	I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.	I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Naomi.	On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
Okay. I wish you could come.	This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.	I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.	But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
So you're still on the Zoloft?	Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Clementine.	I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.	I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.	Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?	Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.	Well... I did.
Well... I did.	We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.	It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --	You have to stop this!
You have to stop this!	What? What do you mean?
What? What do you mean?	I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!	Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Yours?	You take it. I don't know.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.	Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
So what's going on, Joel?	I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.	What?
What?	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --	"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""
"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""	I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.	Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.	No. I just need some space, maybe.
No. I just need some space, maybe.	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	How was it?
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.	Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Go back to sleep.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!	I hope you get your work done.
I hope you get your work done.	Yeah.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.	Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.	Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --	I miss you.
I miss you.	Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.	Oh! Great. That's great!
Oh! Great. That's great!	A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.	I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --	I'm glad you called.
So you think the dissertation will get published?	I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.	I had a good time last night. I really did.
I had a good time last night. I really did.	So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.	We'll speak soon.
We'll speak soon.	'Night.
Oh, hey, Patrick.	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?	Nah, I don't know.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?	Yeah. Cool.
Yeah. Cool.	"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""
"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""	Very cool. Trippy.
Very cool. Trippy.	I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Definitely!	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Boo.	Hi.
Stan... c'mon...	Sorry. I just --
Sorry. I just --	It's just... y'know... I mean...
It's just... y'know... I mean...	I know. Anyway --
I know. Anyway --	Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
See you later, alligator.	'kay.
'kay.	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --	I better do this, Stan.
It's freezing out.	You found us okay?
You found us okay?	Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?	We haven't checked.
We haven't checked.	Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.	That's a good one.
That's a good one.	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.	It's a good one all right.
Yup.	Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?	Yup.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.	Go.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.	Yeah.
Yeah.	To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.

It's stopped.	What?
What?	Listen, it's not erasing.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.	Where?
Where?	I don't know. He's not on the map.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...	Well, what should we do?
Well, what should we do?	I don't know! I just said that!
I don't know! I just said that!	Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.	Shit!
No way. I can handle this.	This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
He's coming?	You better go.
You better go.	Hell no.
Hey.	Do you swear you didn't know?
Do you swear you didn't know?	I swear.
I swear.	And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?	Once, maybe.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.	How did I look?
How did I look?	Happy. Happy with a secret.
And after that?	I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.	Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.	You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.

Oh.	Hi.
Hi.	What do you want, Stan?
What do you want, Stan?	Can I... I brought some --
What's this?	Nothing.
Nothing.	I know what it is.
I know what it is.	Then why did you ask me?
Then why did you ask me?	I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.	They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.	I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.	The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.	Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!	Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Mary...	Yes?
Yes?	Order me a pastrami for after?
Order me a pastrami for after?	Cole slaw, ice tea?
Cole slaw, ice tea?	Thanks.
Thanks.	Welcome, Howard.
Okay, we're back in.	That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.	Well, thank you, Mary.
Do you like quotes, Howard?	How do you mean?
How do you mean?	Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.	Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
"Okay, um, there's one that goes ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."""	Is that Nietzsche?
Is that Nietzsche?	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.	It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.	Alexander Pope?
Alexander Pope?	Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.	It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.	You are such a sweetheart.
That's lovely.	Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --	It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.	Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.	I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
We can't do this.	No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
What, Howard?	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.	"Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!"

Jesus. All right, what's the address.	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.	December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Mary. What are you doing here?	She came to help, Howard.
I tried that already.	Did you try going through C-Gate?
Did you try going through C-Gate?	Yeah. Of course.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.	Yeah, probably a good idea.
Howard, they've disappeared again.	Oh dear.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.	That's fine, Stan.
So, I've got to drop the van off.	Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --	I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.	Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.

This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.	Maybe after the holidays then.
The voltage looks fine.	Then check the connections.
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.

I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.	She was unconscious, Patrick.

Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --	Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Patrick, we're in the middle of --	She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.	Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.	I know who you are.
I know who you are.	Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...	Save your breath for the climb.
But I don't know how to polka.	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
What was that?	Clockworks.
Clockworks.	Clockworks?
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.	Siwash, huh?
Siwash, huh?	He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.	The Clock People?
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.	Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?	"The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled ""Indians"" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that ""Indians"" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906."
What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Is everything getting worse?	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.	The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?	She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.	You mean she's dead?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.	Easy come, easy go.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.	The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?	That's your problem.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?	I'm staying with the Countess.
I'm staying with the Countess.	I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?	I don't.
I don't.	You don't?
You don't?	Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
A traveler, eh?	You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Where are the others?	Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.	Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.	Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.	Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich茅s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Tell me about it.	About...
About...	About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.	Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
You're political, then?	"No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. ""Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."""
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.	Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?	Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet眉kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.	What is Debbie's position?
What is Debbie's position?	Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

You don't agree with Debbie, then?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?	I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
That's Jellybean!	FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.	So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?	Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.

No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.	But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.	If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Extraordinary!	She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?

Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?	I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.

They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S.

I have to go, Julian.	Why? Why do you have to go?
Why? Why do you have to go?	My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Going north?	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
Thanks.	American Cheese. The king of road food.
Are you in show business?	I was a successful model once.

Hitchhiking?	I'm the best.
I'm the best.	You're the best?
You're the best?	When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.	Whooee!
Whooee!	As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?	Tired...
Tired...	That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.

I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months.

You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.	Bonanza Jellybean?
Bonanza Jellybean?	What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.	Your ranch?
Your ranch?	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...	A job for me?
A job for me?	I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?	Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.	But Countess...
But Countess...	Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?	Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...	Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.

What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?	I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?	Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...

Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?	I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.	Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Ballast.	I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
That means top-secret, Cooper.	I heard it.
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.	I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
...do you copy?	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.	Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?	I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Holy shit...	Justin?
Justin?	I think I found something...
Time to play Spam in the can.	Don't start with me, Cooper.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --	You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...	This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!	EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
From what?	You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...	You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...	I'll be all over it.

Coop, where are you...	The containment, Second Containment...
The containment, Second Containment...	Hold on, Coop...

We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.	What about the accumulator...?

Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...	Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.	Roger that.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?	What?
What?	Coffee.
Coffee.	No, thank you.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.	Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...	No, he didn't.
No, he didn't.	You weren't there. I saw it.
You weren't there. I saw it.	Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I don't know what happened to Justin.	I'm telling you, I saw it...
I'm telling you, I saw it...	What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.	"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
Is that an offer?	It is not.
What's happening?	I don't know, the screens are dead...!
Let me breathe, let me breathe...	You're okay now, it's over...
How? The Bridge is gone.	There must be a way! What about Engineering?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?	Can you shut it down?
Can you shut it down?	I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...	I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.	Hurry.
What...?	Run!
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...	Trauma.
Trauma.	And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...	No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
How is he?	His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.	I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.	We'll make it.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.	"""Another man?"" Who?"
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.	No.
What is it?	I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.	Go on.
"They thought it said, ""Liberatis me,"" ""Save me,"" but it's not ""me."" It's ""tutemet:"" ""Save yourself."""	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.	It gets worse.
Do you hear it? Right there.	Hear what?
Hear what?	"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""
"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""	"""Save yourself. From Hell.""  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?"
"""Save yourself. From Hell.""  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?"	No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.	What happened?
What happened?	Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Please...	Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...	Please... kill...
Please... kill...	Oh God...
What's wrong?	Nothing. It's nothing.
What's happening...?	A power drain --
What's wrong?	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
I've got a pulse, he's alive...	Pressure?
Pressure?	90 over 50 and falling... .
90 over 50 and falling... .	He's crashing...

His peritoneum has ruptured...	One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?	I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?	I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.	It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...	A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.	Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You're not seriously considering sending him?	You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.	The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.

It's been two years since she died. He's over it.	Some things you don't get over.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?	The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
What, Justin, what shows you?	It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...	What does?
What does?	The dark inside me.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.	"""The dark inside...""? I don't understand."
"""The dark inside...""? I don't understand."	From the Other Place...
Oh my god OH MY GOD...	Starck!
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.	How do you know all this?
How do you know all this?	I built it.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.	We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.	Background radiation. Perfectly safe.

Everything green on my boards, Skipper.	Start the countdown.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.	Yes, sir!
Justin, finish your sweep.	Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Patch me through to him.	Justin.
Justin.	Skipper, you gotta help me...
...I don't want to die...!	You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?	But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...	Justin. I won't let you die.
This is Weir.	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.	I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.

The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.	The crew? Could they still be alive?
The crew? Could they still be alive?	The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.	Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
What's the hold up?	Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...	No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.	I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
We've got pressure.	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Jesus its huge.	Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
That means they didn't abandon ship.	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Peters is right, no one's here.	I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
I can see the hatch.	Starck, you still showing those readings?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...	There's no one here, Skipper.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.	What you got, Peters?
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.	The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I found one.	Alive?
Alive?	Frozen.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...	...how's the client?
...how's the client?	Crystallized.
Can anybody hear me...	Skipper...
Skipper...	Peters...
Peters...	...you okay?
...you okay?	Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.	I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.	Do it.
That's a negative, Starck.	Justin.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.	I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...	Thanks.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...	The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...	Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.	I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.	Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.	Where has it been for the last seven years?
Where has it been for the last seven years?	That's what we're here to find out.
What does it say?	NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.	Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.	Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...	Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --	That is not acceptable --
That is not acceptable --	-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.	Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
I can see that, what're they for?	In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.	Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Any survivors?	Negative.
No one?	They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.	Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
Yes.	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""	It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.	What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?	It's complicated...
It's complicated...	How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
It's insane.	"""Insane?"" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day..."
"""Insane?"" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day..."	If it worked.
If it worked.	If it worked, yes.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.	There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.	Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
You have something, Dr. Weir?	The date.
The date.	What about it?
What about it?	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.	It's 2041...
It's 2041...	Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Explanation?	Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?	I don't know.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.	The Core...!
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.	I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.	Do it.
"Is that your ""expert opinion?"" The only answer we've had out of you is ""I don't know."""	Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.	Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --	That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!	What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?	You said this ship creates a gateway...
You said this ship creates a gateway...	Yes...
Yes...	To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?	I don't know...
I don't know...	Where has it been for the past seven years?

"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"	I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.	That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
We're leaving.	You can't, your orders are specific...
You can't, your orders are specific...	"""...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship."" The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us."
"""...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship."" The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us."	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.	Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.	Don't... don't do this...
Don't... don't do this...	It's done.
What about my ship?	We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.	You... You can't do that!
You... You can't do that!	Watch me.
You can't leave. She won't let you.	Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
I told you... She won't let you leave...	Son of a bitch!
Your eyes...	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.	What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?	Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.	What makes you think I'll miss?
Weir is dead.	Then who the fuck are you?
Then who the fuck are you?	Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
What are you?	You know.
You know.	You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!	I'm not the Devil.
I'm not the Devil.	Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Then what, what are you? Tell me...	Better if I just show you.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.	You're lying...!
You're lying...!	I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.	Starck... Cooper...
You can't have them. Go to hell.	NOOO!
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?	Locked and cocked.
Jesus...	What is that?
Heading three-three-four...	...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...	One-four degrees...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.	Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...	That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...	"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""
"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""	Something like that, yeah.
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	Dr. Weir...!
We've got some weather.	I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
1500 meters. We're getting too close...	Where is it?
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!	Starck...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?	Love to.
It is now.  We're locked in.	Starck, give me a read.
Captain Miller...	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Smith, where the hell have you been?!	We have a situation here...
Do we have enough time for a weld?	We don't have time to fart.
We don't have time to fart.	We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.	No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?	They're gone.
But...	You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
Captain Miller, you copy?	I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?	I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.	We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.	Understood.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...	That's enough!
Sir.	Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Thank you.	Captain, we got a problem.
Captain, we got a problem.	Now what?
Now what?	She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.	Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Skipper...	What is it, Smith?
What is it, Smith?	I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Smith, get out of there...	Come again, Skipper?
Come again, Skipper?	One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.	No, no, we just got her back together...
No, no, we just got her back together...	Get out of there now!
Where is it, where is it...	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.	Justin?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.	Let's go.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?	I just finished drying...
I just finished drying...	Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.	Come around to three-three-four...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.	Radiation interference?
Radiation interference?	There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
That's an affirmative.	Keep your eyes open.
Everybody okay?	We're all here.
We're all here.	Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
It tastes bad.	But you can breathe it.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.	How much oh-two do we have?
How much oh-two do we have?	Oxygen is not the problem.
Oxygen is not the problem.	Carbon dioxide?
Carbon dioxide?	It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.	We can take the filters from the Clark...
We can take the filters from the Clark...	I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.	What about the life readings you picked up?
What about the life readings you picked up?	"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."
"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."	What's causing the readings?
What's causing the readings?	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.	So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.	I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.	Do it. Dr. Weir...
Maybe one of the original crew?	No. It was someone else.
No. It was someone else.	Who?
Who?	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
Miller...	What is it, Starck?
What is it, Starck?	...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...	"""...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,"" don't you have anything useful to tell me?"
"""...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,"" don't you have anything useful to tell me?"	I've got a theory.
Go ahead.	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
You've got to listen...	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?	I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...	We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.	I know that.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.	Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.	I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
Miller, come in...	What's going on in there, Starck?
What's going on in there, Starck?	Justin's in the airlock.
What?	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.	Stay here! Don't stop working!
I'm on my way, Starck.	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!	Five seconds.
Weir can't be alive.	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.	We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.	Blow it up?
Blow it up?	We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
I'll do it --	No. I'll be right back.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...	...repeat, we're armed...
...repeat, we're armed...	Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
Weir.	He's dead...
First time in a grav couch?	Yes.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.	He's been past Mars?
He's been past Mars?	He served on the Goliath.
He served on the Goliath.	Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?	They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
Claire...	DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.	They're explosive charges.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?	Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.	Can you see a body?
Can you see a body?	There's no one here.
No. I saw nothing.	I did.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?	I've seen bodies before. This is different.
There's no one in the corridor but us.	Not according to the computer.
He's engaged the override.	Can you shut it down?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.	Keep him talking.
Keep him talking.	Do you know what it was?
Almost got it.	Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
We have to do something, oh God...	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
You got any coffee?	It's cold.
It's cold.	I don't care.
Hey...	"Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from ""point A"" here...  ...to ""point B,"" here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?"
Where is she?	Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...	She's not ugly.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?	Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
What the hell is that?	That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
The safety circuit's failed!	We're losing atmosphere...
What?	It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.	Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.	Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...	Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.	All boards are green, everything's five by five.
You can't do that.	The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...	Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
If they are, they're screening their calls.	Range 3000 meters and closing.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...	1000 meters...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...	Picking up magnetic interference.
What happened to his eyes?	Explosive decompression.
Explosive decompression.	Decompression wouldn't do that.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Get them back --
Get them back --	I'm trying, goddammit --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
"Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously ""jump"" from one point in the universe to another, light years away."	How?
How?	Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
A straight line.	Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.	Do they have pressure?
Do they have pressure?	Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?	If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
What is it?	Ship's log.
What is it?	I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.	I can't believe we built this.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.	Claire is your wife?
Claire is your wife?	Yes.
Yes.	It must be hard, being so far away from her.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.	Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.	I'm sorry.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...	No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.	I'm alright. Please.
What is it?	The forward airlock.
The forward airlock.	Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"	It means nothing.
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
How'd you know it was me?	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I'm not really dressed for a party.	Relax, it's casual.
Relax, it's casual.	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Those yours too?	My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.	"""Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."""
"""Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."""	This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --	I wouldn't know anything about that.
I wouldn't know anything about that.	I mean...
I mean...	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?	I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?	Victor did.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.	Is it safe?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
You look like an eighties rock band.	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
The suit will stretch. You should try it --	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
Oh, he did.	What did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --	It's easy for you to be patient.
It's easy for you to be patient.	No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you.	About me? How sweet.
About me? How sweet.	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
Ben, come in.	What is this? Where's Reed?
What is this? Where's Reed?	Where do you think? With Sue.
What do you want, Vic?	To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --	He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""	And you can? Power it up?
I'll be watching over you.	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.	I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.	Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Ben?	"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"	Baby, you're scaring me.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.	You'd never know it.
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --	Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --	We got what we wanted. That's enough.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.	I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Can't do it. I cannot do it.	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --	No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.	Youthful high spirits.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.	I'm sure he's matured since then.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.
Five times.	I had it at four.
I had it at four.	This makes five.
Isn't that your speech?	He's made a few changes.
He's made a few changes.	This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.	Victor's better at these things.
The shields on the station should protect us.	Should?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
How long was I out?	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?	Solid.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.	Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.	I should have done more, run more tests --
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?	He's smart, powerful, successful --
He's smart, powerful, successful --	Well maybe you should date him.
Are you alright?	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
What the --!	Ben. Are you okay?
Ben. Are you okay?	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
You got a chisel round here?	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --	O-kay. We'll skip that question.
It's about to be a broken face.	This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Ben --	Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?	We're working as hard as we can --
We're working as hard as we can --	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...	Got it, teach.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...	Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.	'Course not. Strictly business.
'Course not. Strictly business.	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.	Don't you wander off, boy.
Where... where am I?	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.	Reed?... Sue?
Reed?... Sue?	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
What's wrong with me?	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --	Give me a mirror...
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --	Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey! That's a prototype!	Go back to the drawing board.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --	Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
No more cracks about how I look.	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --	And they're changing into...
And they're changing into...	I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
"What do you mean ""complete""?"	I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What?	The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...	That's terrible news...
And where do we think we're going?	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --"
You're hot!	So are you!
So are you!	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Me like-y.	Stay right. Left is trouble.
Stay right. Left is trouble.	I though we went over this.
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
You're on fire!	Not this again --
Not this again --	No: You're ON FIRE!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.	What about you?
He's not responsive --	Ben! Ben!
Now what is up with that?	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!	Ben, are you there?
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.	Oh, it is.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
This place is deluxe. You got cable?	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
Back it down, Johnny!	I can go hotter!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.	Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --	What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --	What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --	They're not costumes.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --	Right, whatever, have fun.
You need to control yourself and think before you --	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.	But all these people...
But all these people...	Now.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Apparently I can disappear.	Please tell me you go silent too.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --	Johnny.
Stop it.	"Okay, ""mom."""
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You're really cramping my style here.	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --	Sweet.
Sweet.	That's the temperature of the sun.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.	Girl...?!
I'm driving.	Dude. That's my sister.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!	"You gave us names? What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
Johnny? Did you see Ben?	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.	"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --	As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
What are you doing --	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.	But Johnny... you can't fly.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.	And if he's not...?
And if he's not...?	Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --	It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.	Then what is it?
Then what is it?	History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
How's the IPO?	Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --	Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."	And that's a good thing?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --	Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --	"That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not mine."""
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --	Front page?
Front page?	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --	I was talking about us. Working together.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--	Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.	Great minds think alike.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
Yes, thanks.	That's good. That's uh... good.
That's good. That's uh... good.	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
You're happy for me and Victor.	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --	Which was?
Which was?	Passion.
For science.	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
What? What do you mean you --	Sue... look at your hands.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What?	We need to get past them.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.	What...?  Oh.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.
That's what we're here to find out.	If it happened to him, then it could...
"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge."	What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --	Excuse me?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --	Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --	What in the world would give me that idea?
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.	I think it was a little more complicated than --
I think it was a little more complicated than --	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
There were a lot of variables to consider --	No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
What are you doing?	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --	And reverse the mutations --
And reverse the mutations --	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?	Of course. Of course.
Of course. Of course.	And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --	Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.	You were?
You were?	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?	I gave him twenty.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.	I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.	Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you say something?	That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
I can... make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --	The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --	You need a doctor.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I found a broken gasket, from space --	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.	You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --	The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.	Sure.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.	Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...	Ben's still out there --
Ben's still out there --	So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Come on, Ben, come on...	Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?	Ben did this.
Ben did this.	Ben did this?
Ben did this?	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --	Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --	I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
What are you doing here?	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
But I'm not done with the machine --	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
It's just business.	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?	I understand the business reasons.
I understand the business reasons.	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
What are you doing?	Raising the shields.
Raising the shields.	You can't leave them out there.
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
Victor, your scar --	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
You said it was urgent.	It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --	Susan. What are you doing?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, I think you already have.	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
'Scuse me.	I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Reed's gonna fix me up --	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.	Skeptical...?
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?	Arnold. What's happening?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.	You want to work at Carl's?
You want to work at Carl's?	Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.	I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.	All right!!
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?	Of course.
Of course.	How much did they cost?
How much did they cost?	Don't worry about it.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...	Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.	Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!	I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.	If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.	Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.	Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Something happened to them, mon.	Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.
Totally.	It's the first door on your left.
I can't find it, mon!	It's the first door on your left!
It's the first door on your left!	On the ledge?
On the ledge?	First door on your left!
First door on your left!	There it is!
Easy, mon.	Later.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?	This is how I dress all the time.
This is how I dress all the time.	But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.	I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!	You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?	Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.	No. I want my money back right now.
No. I want my money back right now.	Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...	See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...	Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?	I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.	I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.	Manager!!
Hi, Brad.	Sis.
